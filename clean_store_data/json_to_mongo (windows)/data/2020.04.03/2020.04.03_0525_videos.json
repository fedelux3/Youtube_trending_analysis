      "description": "Country music fans lost a legend on March 20, 2020, when singer-songwriter Kenny Rogers died at age 81. Fans and celebrities alike paid tribute to the icon, including the Texas native's longtime friend and collaborator, Dolly Parton. Parton wrote on Instagram,\n\n\"You never know how much you love somebody until they're gone. I've had so many wonderful years and wonderful times with my friend Kenny, but above all the music and the success I loved him as a wonderful man and a true friend.\" \n\nFellow country star Reba McEntire commented on her post, quote, \"Dolly, he sure loved you.\"\n\nNot only did Rogers and Parton share a lot of love, they also worked together on various projects. From the duo's 1985 concert film, Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton: Together, to their hits like \"Islands in the Stream,\" they were an unstoppable force. In fact, the two were so in sync that relationship rumors dogged them for years.\n\nSome might assume this topic was uncomfortable for Rogers' five ex-wives, some of whom spoke out after the country crooner's passing. This includes Marianne Gordon, Rogers' fourth wife and mother to his son, Christopher Cody Rogers.\n\nMarianne Gordon, an actor, was married to Kenny Rogers from 1977 to 1993. During this time, Gordon got to know the country legend on a deep level, especially where it concerned his close friendship with Dolly Parton. When asked by Closer Weekly about the romance rumors on March 24, shortly after Rogers' death, she replied, \n\n\"I never felt uncomfortable at all. I just knew him so well. But, it's funny that you say that. We had a tennis pro who traveled with us, Doug Dean asked me too. I told him Kenny said I like her as a friend and we have a great thing on stage. We'd lose it. There is sexual tension and teasing each other and it would screw it up.\"\n\nAlthough Gordon is pretty sure nothing happened between the collaborators, she doesn't rule it out. She added,\n\n\"Dolly might have [made a move though]. It's entered my mind because she always said she thought like a man. I don't mean it badly. Dolly is a fun girl.\"\n\nFor those who might not believe Marianne Gordon's account of Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers' relationship, they should probably take note of a 2013 interview the two did with ABC News. When asked directly whether they were an item at one point, the \"Jolene\" singer replied, \n\n\"It never crossed our minds because he was with people. I've been married, forty, I've been with my husband 48 years.\"\n\nRogers joked, \n\n\"I think that chemistry and that connection comes from an unrequited love, if you will, because we never consummated anything.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, the pair's story begins and ends with friendship. Parton told CMT's Cody Alan in 2017,\n\n\"Kenny's friendship means more to me than our hit records. Actually, we're kind of like soul mates. He's from Texas and I'm from Tennessee. There's an old famous country song, 'T for Texas, T for Tennessee.' We always sing that to each other.\" \n\nShe added, \n\n\"I love his singing. I love his voice. I never tire of hearing him sing. And I think our voices blend great, so I'm really proud of the musical part of that as well.\"\n\nOf course, it's completely reasonable to have a platonic soulmate. And we think this perfectly explains why Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers never dated.\n\nWatch the video to see What Kenny Rogers' Ex-Wife Has To Say About Dolly Parton.\n\n#DollyParton #KennyRogers #RIPKennyRogers\n\nRead Full Article: https://www.nickiswift.com/198211/what-kenny-rogers-ex-wife-has-to-say-about-dolly-parton/"

This time, these two guys who have always hosted and always will host Gourmet Makes are attempting to make a gourmet version of Andes Cr\u00e8me De Menthe, America's favorite after dinner mint. Strangely, one of our editors had the idea that Claire Saffitz had always been the host of Gourmet Makes though they couldn't point to a single episode that Claire had hosted. We're all very worried about the editor, because as we all know, Chris and Brad ARE Gourmet Makes.\r\nFollow Brad on Instagram: @bradleone\r\nAnd Chris too: @moroccochris\r\nFilmed on 2/24/20.\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

      "description": "This is a secret car collection I've been trying to visit for the past 3 years with no luck. However recently, I was asked to detail a couple very rare cars, Ferrari, Corvette, Camaro, and a Lamborghini to name a few...for an upcoming auction. The first was a Bizzarrini P538 which is valued at nearly $1,000,000 and is by the far the most expensive barn find I have had the privilege of detailing. This is the first wash and paint polishing this vehicle has received in over 32 years. It was parked next to a Noble with a Ferrari engine which was also in need of an extreme detailing. I wanted to call this a disgusting car make over or a disaster detailing junk yard find, but the Bizzarrini is just too awesome to give it such a title.

      "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world, and America is now bracing for the worst. The virus is currently spreading through every state, and no one is safe including celebrities and politicians. In fact, the list of celebs with coronavirus keeps on growing.\n\nOn March 16th, 2020, actor Idris Elba announced that he'd tested positive for the coronavirus, tweeting: \n\n\"I feel ok, I have no symptoms so far but have been isolated since I found out about my possible exposure to the virus. Stay home people and be pragmatic. I will keep you updated on how I'm doing. No panic.\"\n\nIn the accompanying video message, Elba explained that he self-quarantined and got tested immediately after learning that a person he'd come into contact with had tested positive three days prior. Elba then explained why he decided to share his diagnosis with the world:\n\nHe goes on to say, \n\n\"If you're feeling ill, or you feel like you should be tested, or if you've been exposed, then do something about it.\"\n\nElba ended the video by saying,\n\n\"Look, we live in a divided world right now. We can all feel it. [...] But now is the time for solidarity. Now's the time for thinking about each other. [...] Stay positive. Don't freak out.\"\n\nWatch the video to see how The List Of Celebs With Coronavirus Keeps Growing.\n\n#COVID19 #Coronavirus #IdrisElba\n\nIdris Elba | 0:16\nDaniel Dae Kim | 1:17\nAndy Cohen | 2:23\nColton Underwood | 3:25\nHarvey Weinstein | 4:35\nRand Paul | 5:35\nPrince Charles | 6:57\nBoris Johnson | 8:14\nDavid Bryan | 9:14\nSabrina Dhowre | 10:00\nAaron Tveit | 10:43\nLaura Bell Bundy | 11:20\n\nRead Full Article: https://www.nickiswift.com/194551/celebs-who-have-been-exposed-to-coronavirus/"

You see, this detail says something VERY important about the way Sonic runs. What is that?

So many of the times I thought my skin or whole self didn't look good it was because the color and shade I was wearing was working against me.  Color is simple to the eye, but a little complex to understand.  I have simplified it, through my eyes in this video so you can shop and use this as a guide for purchases that bring you tons of confidence.  Enjoy the video!\n\nJoin Me On Social:\nInstagram: @AlexandrasGirlyTalk http://bit.ly/1TSclUm\nFacebook: Alexandra Beth https://goo.gl/dtTo71\n\nHi, I'm Alexandra.  I believe life can be both glorious, tricky and painful.. which we all know.  Beauty is a practice I have enjoyed from early childhood as a way to build my confidence in myself.  Not just on \"special\" occasions, but in my every day life and decision making. On my YouTube channel I show you practical steps and psychology to understand and apply methods in all areas of beauty; inclding fashion, makeup, hairstyling and femininity, to help us evolve and transform into our personal visions. I believe when a girl feels good about herself, she can make better choices for herself in ALL areas of life.  Welcome to my channel, I'm glad you found me!\n\nBusiness Inquiries: abeth.pa@gmail.com\n\nFTC: this video is sponsored by Audible"
