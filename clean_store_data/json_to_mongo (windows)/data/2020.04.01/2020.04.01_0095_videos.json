Plus they\u2019re making a 4FT Snickers bar, massive Butterfinger, and other epic real chocolate vs sour gummy food like you\u2019ve never seen before.

Today brothers (not twins) the key bros compete to make giant edible donuts, Wonka Nerds Ropes, and Kinder Eggs 1000x their normal size. And try not to laugh at the end as Collins and Devan bite, taste, and try their creations. Trying and testing these foods are so much fun!

Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! \n\nOn this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes \u201cgimmicky\u201d golf clubs.
