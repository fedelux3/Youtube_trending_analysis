We\u2019re brokenhearted,\nOne more day all on my phone, Will we ever meet again? Will we ever meet our friends?One more selfie with me glaring, I am bored of being with you, Not long till the data\u2019s blown,So we swear until we\u2019re blue, But they never let me share\nOne more day of \u201conline school\u201d Do we get a change of clothes? Teachers fill up Google classroom, Have you seen my brother\u2019s hair?!Our exams have all been pulled,Do I change my underwear? And we\u2019re sharing a bathroom,\nThe time is now, the day is here, one day more\u2026 One more day\u2019s home education, Let\u2019s just let them run amuck, We\u2019re not ready for these schoolboys, \u2018Cos they just don\u2019t give a f***\nOne day more\u2026Watch our daddy drink, see our mummy sigh, Clapping for the NHS can make \u2018em cry,Here\u2019s a little walk, there\u2019s a little ride, Sunshine\u2019s such a bummer when we\u2019re stuck inside\nOne day to a new beginning,Make some respirators now!Every man will need vaccines,That\u2019s a little bit sexist! There\u2019s a new world to be winning, There\u2019s a new world to be won\nDo you hear the people sing?My pizza\u2019s here, I eat with you! One day more\u2026We will join the people\u2019s heroes we will phone those left alone We will volunteer to help out, we will grow what we can grow\nOne day more\u2026Tomorrow we\u2019ll be far away, tomorrow is the judgement day, Tomorrow we\u2019ll discover what Tesco online has got in store, One more dawn, One more day, One day more!"

What they are expected to do now requires superhuman talent, strength, care and total commitment. Yet there they are, on the frontline for us, battling with everything they have to try to save us.\n\n\"That\u2019s why I\u2019m behind this and any other project that collectively forms a nationwide, deafening chorus of 'Thank you, you are incredible, we appreciate every single one of you and we will do anything we can to help you through these unprecedented times'.\"\n\nScott Garnham, founder of The Barricade Boys says: \"Music has this incredible power to make people stop and listen. \"Bring Him Home\" will resonate with so many people \u2013 it\u2019s a trying and scary time for everyone but we still have a lot to be grateful for, in particular, our incredible NHS. This is just a very small way of saying thank you.\""

      "description": "The backyard dirt jumps are looking amazing. I've built what could be a full line of trails ready to be ridden on MTB or BMX. Right now the jumps aren't massive but now I've built these important two hip jumps, the speed won't be such an issue and the new dirt jumps will be massive! I've promised to build a whatetail feature in the next trail building video. thanks for all the support and unreal comments. Keep them coming and enjoy this episode of my garden trails & pit bike track and see you soon for more trail building progress!"

I am not in ANY way obligated to mention these products and if I have done so, it is because I genuinely like them. I would NEVER talk about or show something I didn't genuinely love.\n\nSometimes, I may be sponsored by brands for videos. I turn down 90% of sponsorship opportunities. I will not accept unless I love the brand/product already. All products/items will still have been chosen by myself, and the video concept will always be my own idea. I would never endorse a brand/product that I didn't truly love and believe in.\n\nI use affiliate links in the description box of this channel. This means I earn a very small percentage when you purchase a product I recommend- the same way a sales associate in a store earns commission when they help you select a product. This does not in any way affect the price you pay for the item, and absolutely does not influence my choice of items to show you. \n\nLots of love,\n\nFreds x\n\n#selfisolation #lockdown #stayhome #isolation"
