Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end. We've even got 44 Club merch now! So yeh, that's the story. Pretty random but good fun at the same time.\n\nWe are passionate about seeing children released from poverty and we would love you to consider sponsoring a child with Compassion. We visited our sponsor children in the Philippines and were blown away by the difference that child sponsorship can make. To find out more about sponsoring a child right now, check out: http://cmpsn.co/howridiculous\n\nWhat Slow Mo Camera Do We Use? We've got the The Chronos 1.4 which shoots 1500fps at 720p.

      "description": "MADRID -- Before the outbreak in Spain began, the only people who went in and out of the small hospital where Alfonso Molina Moreno works as a nurse were visitors, staffers, and cleaning crews. Patients come to Hospital La Fuenfria for long-term, palliative care and Moreno, who has worked as a nurse for 16 years, found a sense of purpose in bringing them care and company at the end of their lives. \n\nNow, he and his colleagues worry that they\u2019re doing harm. A few days before we spoke, patients at the facility started testing positive for COVID-19. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where it came from,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether we, the staff, brought it here. We don\u2019t know whether it was due to the patients\u2019 visitors. We don\u2019t know the source.\u201d \n\nThe hospital has cut off all visits. Staffers now take exhaustive precautions when working with patients who have tested positive\u2014putting on protective equipment they dispose of in contaminated rooms and washing their hands on both sides of the door. \n\nBut there\u2019s still a degree of uncertainty. When we spoke, Morena hadn\u2019t been tested, and Spain\u2019s health ministry says health workers currently make up nearly 14-percent of positive cases. Now, as the country scrambles to contain the virus it\u2019s ordered 640,000 test kits from China and Korea in an effort to screen health workers and the most vulnerable. The hope is that this will help identify people who need to self-isolate. \n\nMorena isn\u2019t just thinking of the patients he\u2019s now caring for. He\u2019s worried about how long the virus was in the hospital. After a patient with cervical cancer died, a post-mortem X-ray showed her lungs had advanced, bilateral pneumonia. \u201cIt could have been coronavirus, right? She wasn\u2019t tested,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s like, oh my God, to what extent\u2014let\u2019s see, this needs a pinch of salt but\u2014what if it was me? That's it. So I can\u2019t hide it, because you really don\u2019t know. Even with all the security measures in place, you still don\u2019t know.\u201d \n\nLike everyone working despite an outbreak, Morena worries about infecting his loved ones. \u201cI told this to my colleagues, and we have this kind of sharing moment. We're all going through this bad phase, this suffering.\u201d But he isn\u2019t thinking about quitting. \u201cI really find myself fortunate to be able to work because I have the chance to go and feel useful,\u201d he says. He\u2019s even volunteered to take on more shifts. \u201cThe healthcare providers, at this moment, we have to be there no matter what. Because if it is not us, who will it be then? There is no one else.\u201d \n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\n\n#VICENews #News"

      "description": "One giant \u00a320 burrito. Hundreds of attempts. Could I dethrone the champ and get the meal on the house? I know what you're thinking; judging by the length of the video...Probably....But give it a watch anyway ;)\n\nIn part three of this mini-series, I'm taking on Plan Burrito's 'Man Vs Plan' challenge, whereby if you can beat the current fastest time to finish their giant burrito, you get the meal on the house. This also might break a record for the shortest video I've ever published, but don't worry the next too are a length you're more accustomed to....Giggity...\n\n***UPDATE - PLEASE READ***\n\nPlease bear in mind, like many YouTube creators, I film almost all of my content 10-21 days prior to publish date. So for those of you concerned that I'm ignoring the current national social distancing effort, I'm not. \n\n***NEW VIDEOS EVERY THURSDAY AND SUNDAY AT 7PM GMT***\n\nFOLLOW ME:\nFacebook/Twitter/Instagram: @BeardMeatsFood\n\nFOLLOW MRS BEARD:\nInstagram: @Mrs_Beard_Eats\n\nALL-NEW MERCHANDISE IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE VIA TEESPRING (USE THE MERCHANDISE SHELF ABOVE OR SEARCH 'BEARDMEATSFOOD TEESPRING').\n\nANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS & ADDITIONAL INFO:\n\nQ: How come you don\u2019t get fat? \nA: I eat like this for 1 hour of a 168 hour long week. In simple terms, I eat at caloric maintenance over the course of time, meaning I don\u2019t gain weight.\n\nQ: Don\u2019t you worry about your health?\nA: Not in particular. I\u2019m active. I eat nutrient dense foods five days a week. And, I get quarterly bloods done, amongst other health checks.\n\nMusic credits to my man FLORIAN HAACK for the incredible video game metal covers!\n\nSEND ME STUFF:\n\nBeard Meats Food\nPO Box 200\nCASTLEFORD\nWF10 9DR\nUNITED KINGDOM\n\n#FoodChallenge #EatingShow #BurritoChallenge"
