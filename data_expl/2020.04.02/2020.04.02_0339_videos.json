      "description": "Thank you so much to FOREO SWEDEN for working with me on this video!\nCheck out their products here:  https://foreo.se/hd3v\nIn this video, I use the Manuka Honey mask with UFO 2 smart mask treatment by FOREO Sweden and this particular mask has Korean formula designed for dry and dehydrated skin, which mine currently is! I have been using this device in my skincare routine for a couple of months now and over time my skin has become softer and it has soothed the dryness massively! I can't compare this treatment with any sheet mask I've used before!! My skin feels incredible after using it, I cannot recommend it enough.

The ground is finally hardening up ready for riding but with less and less dirt, we've had to turn towards wooden features to make progress! So in this lockdown episode I decided to fulfil a lot your requests and build an MTB whale tail, which is a slopestyle feature from competitions like Crankworx! Unfortunately we don't have unlimited supplies of wood or timber so had to get resourceful again to make it happen. It was sick to do some riding and shout out to Ben for hitting it on his BMX. In the next video we'll be riding the trails, so stay tuned for some backyard dirt jump action! Legends"

      "description": "There's been another big rise in the number of people who have died from coronavirus in the UK - 563 in the last 24 hours.  The government has said it\u2019s the biggest threat to the country in decades and worse is to come.  Most of the cases are in London but NHS England says the threat is everywhere and the growing number of hospital admissions in the Midlands is now a cause for concern. Nearly a million people have applied for universal credit benefits in the past fortnight - almost 10 times the usual number.\u00a0  Meanwhile there\u2019s been more criticism that the government hasn\u2019t acted fast enough to increase testing for Coronavirus.

      "description": "The Marsh family sharing their lockdown-themed coronavirus pandemic in the style of Les Mis\u00e9rables.\n\nThe Marsh Family's One Day More, lyrics:\n\nOne day more, another day another destiny,Shopping for online delivery,I\u2019ve tried again, only to find there\u2019s nothing til September timeOne day more\u2026\nI had a football match today, How can I play when we are parted?One day more\u2026Our grandparents are miles away, They can\u2019t work Skype! We\u2019re brokenhearted,\nOne more day all on my phone, Will we ever meet again? Will we ever meet our friends?One more selfie with me glaring, I am bored of being with you, Not long till the data\u2019s blown,So we swear until we\u2019re blue, But they never let me share\nOne more day of \u201conline school\u201d Do we get a change of clothes? Teachers fill up Google classroom, Have you seen my brother\u2019s hair?!Our exams have all been pulled,Do I change my underwear? And we\u2019re sharing a bathroom,\nThe time is now, the day is here, one day more\u2026 One more day\u2019s home education, Let\u2019s just let them run amuck, We\u2019re not ready for these schoolboys, \u2018Cos they just don\u2019t give a f***\nOne day more\u2026Watch our daddy drink, see our mummy sigh, Clapping for the NHS can make \u2018em cry,Here\u2019s a little walk, there\u2019s a little ride, Sunshine\u2019s such a bummer when we\u2019re stuck inside\nOne day to a new beginning,Make some respirators now!Every man will need vaccines,That\u2019s a little bit sexist! There\u2019s a new world to be winning, There\u2019s a new world to be won\nDo you hear the people sing?My pizza\u2019s here, I eat with you! One day more\u2026We will join the people\u2019s heroes we will phone those left alone We will volunteer to help out, we will grow what we can grow\nOne day more\u2026Tomorrow we\u2019ll be far away, tomorrow is the judgement day, Tomorrow we\u2019ll discover what Tesco online has got in store, One more dawn, One more day, One day more!"

      "description": "Brad Leone and Chris Morocco are back for another episode of Gourmet Makes. This time, these two guys who have always hosted and always will host Gourmet Makes are attempting to make a gourmet version of Andes Cr\u00e8me De Menthe, America's favorite after dinner mint. Strangely, one of our editors had the idea that Claire Saffitz had always been the host of Gourmet Makes though they couldn't point to a single episode that Claire had hosted. We're all very worried about the editor, because as we all know, Chris and Brad ARE Gourmet Makes.\r\nFollow Brad on Instagram: @bradleone\r\nAnd Chris too: @moroccochris\r\nFilmed on 2/24/20.\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?
