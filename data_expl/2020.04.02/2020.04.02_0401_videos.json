      "description": "This was the last video we filmed before the worldwide isolations began, and we recognise some ingredients may be harder to come by in these times. The amazing thing with curries is they are ultra versatile: \n\n- Don\u2019t have a veggie? Simply substitute it with one you have in the fridge. \n- Don\u2019t have fresh spinach? Try frozen spinach, or just leave it out. \n- Substitute the beans for lentils, or vice versa. \n- If you don\u2019t have one of the spices, simply omit it, or substitute it for curry powder. The other spices will still come together to make the dish super flavourful. \n- Don't have the garnishes? You definitely don't need them - the curries are flavourful enough on their own! \n\nIt\u2019s hard to go wrong with any of these recipes, and who knows? Maybe your variation will be even better than the original!

      "description": "The world continues to battle the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and countries are taking different measures in an effort to slow the spread. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says more help is on the way for seniors, children and domestic abuse victims. But as Abigail Bimman reports, some vulnerable groups at risk say they still don't have the support they need. \n\nPlus, despite a low number of reported cases of COVID-19 in young people, there are calls for more research into how the virus impacts children, and the role they play in the spread of the pandemic. Ross Lords reports. \n\nIn the U.S., President Donald Trump extended social distancing guidelines until April 30 after America's top infectious disease official warned millions of people could be infected there, and 200,00 people could die. Jennifer Johnson reports. \n\nWhile the number of cases rise and impacts are seen on global travel and commerce, the environment is seeing a different result as the virus has resulted in a stark drop in pollution levels. Redmond Shannon reports. \n\nMeanwhile, as the world's attention is fixed on COVID-19, so is the focus on frontline health care workers, putting their own lives at risk to help. As Robin Gill reports, one photographer in Vancouver has started a social media campaign to tell their stories. \n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/tag/coronavirus/\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\r\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\r\nFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\r\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\r\n#GlobalNews #COVID19 #coronavirus"

Shop our chai here: https://www.chaiwalachai.com\n\nFriends featured in today\u2019s van life vlog:\nLee https://www.instagram.com/leemacmil/\n\nAfter an incredible 3 years of living, working and travelling in our self converted Sprinter Van we\u2019ve had to make the very tough decision to abandon our tiny home in Africa to take a rescue flight back to Canada.  As it has for so, so many of us, this global pandemic has absolutely flipped our world upside down. What went from a virus that seemed far away in China, quickly made it\u2019s way across the globe forcing us to quarantine in our 60 sq-ft in Morocco. And while quarantining was going well for us it became apparent that things would be different for a long while.  When our Prime Minister announced that he was sending repatriation flights over to Africa to pick up Canadians who were stuck (due to border closures) we consulted with friends and family closest to us and realized that in this time of crisis we should be back in our home country. The gravity of what we\u2019ve just done hasn\u2019t quite sunk in and we ((especially me (Bec)) are having a really hard time adjusting to our new reality.  Having said that we think the most important thing we can all do now is STAY HOME, keep healthy with healing foods & try to look at this as a time that we (and the planet) desperately needed to reset and realign.  Sending each of you so much love throughout this time x\n\n\u2733 Eamon & Bec Products \u2733\n\u21a0 our handmade chai blends https://chaiwalachai.com/ \u219e\n\u21a0 our plant-based cookbook https://www.eamonandbec.com/weekday-whip-ups \u219e\n\u21a0 our beautiful photo filters https://www.eamonandbec.com/presets \u219e\n\nTour the renovations we've done to our self converted sprinter van:\nVAN TOUR after 2 years living in our TINY HOUSE on wheels http://bit.ly/newvantour\n\nOVERLANDING AFRICA IN OUR SPRINTER VAN has been the adventure we\u2019ve always hoped it would be but it\u2019s hard to predict what happens next. In fact, we are still processing everything that has happened over the last week and continues to happen... No one knows where we will end up, where our beloved tiny home on wheels will make it or for how long this pandemic will take over life as we know but all we can do is try to remain positive and move forward in the direction that feels right for us.
