      "description": "The first video in a three-part series about Alters. In this first instalment, we explain what alters are, how alters can be different from each other, and WHY alters are different from each other, specifically in terms of gender! Scroll down for sources and studies used/referenced in this video.\n\nDisclaimer I forgot to mention in editing - the trauma I reference is just ONE reason why SOME alters differ from the bodies designated birth sex, but these types of alters are very common and YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS TO HAVE AN ALTER OF THE OPPOSITE SEX. \n\nEnjoying learning about Dissociative Identity Disorder?

Shop our chai here: https://www.chaiwalachai.com\n\nFriends featured in today\u2019s van life vlog:\nLee https://www.instagram.com/leemacmil/\n\nAfter an incredible 3 years of living, working and travelling in our self converted Sprinter Van we\u2019ve had to make the very tough decision to abandon our tiny home in Africa to take a rescue flight back to Canada.  As it has for so, so many of us, this global pandemic has absolutely flipped our world upside down. What went from a virus that seemed far away in China, quickly made it\u2019s way across the globe forcing us to quarantine in our 60 sq-ft in Morocco. And while quarantining was going well for us it became apparent that things would be different for a long while.  When our Prime Minister announced that he was sending repatriation flights over to Africa to pick up Canadians who were stuck (due to border closures) we consulted with friends and family closest to us and realized that in this time of crisis we should be back in our home country. The gravity of what we\u2019ve just done hasn\u2019t quite sunk in and we ((especially me (Bec)) are having a really hard time adjusting to our new reality.  Having said that we think the most important thing we can all do now is STAY HOME, keep healthy with healing foods & try to look at this as a time that we (and the planet) desperately needed to reset and realign.  Sending each of you so much love throughout this time x\n\n\u2733 Eamon & Bec Products \u2733\n\u21a0 our handmade chai blends https://chaiwalachai.com/ \u219e\n\u21a0 our plant-based cookbook https://www.eamonandbec.com/weekday-whip-ups \u219e\n\u21a0 our beautiful photo filters https://www.eamonandbec.com/presets \u219e\n\nTour the renovations we've done to our self converted sprinter van:\nVAN TOUR after 2 years living in our TINY HOUSE on wheels http://bit.ly/newvantour\n\nOVERLANDING AFRICA IN OUR SPRINTER VAN has been the adventure we\u2019ve always hoped it would be but it\u2019s hard to predict what happens next. In fact, we are still processing everything that has happened over the last week and continues to happen... No one knows where we will end up, where our beloved tiny home on wheels will make it or for how long this pandemic will take over life as we know but all we can do is try to remain positive and move forward in the direction that feels right for us.

It was led by Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick, who was joined - 2m apart, of course - by deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries. \n\n\n\nIt could be at least six months before life in the UK returns to \"normal\", England's deputy chief medical officer has said.\n\nSpeaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Dr Jenny Harries added: \"This is not to say we would be in complete lockdown for six months.\"\n\nBut, she added, \"We have to be really, really responsible and keep doing what we're all doing.\"\n\nDr Harries said the government would review the lockdown measures for the first time in three weeks.\n\nBut she warned the public: \"We must not then suddenly revert to our normal way of living. That would be quite dangerous.\"\n\nShe continued: \"If we stop then all of our efforts will be wasted and we could potentially see a second peak.\n\n\"So over time, probably over the next six months, we will have a three-week review. We will see where we are going.\n\n\"We need to keep that lid on - and then gradually we will be able to hopefully adjust some of the social distancing measures and gradually get us all back to normal.\n\n\"Three weeks for review, two or three months to see whether we have really squashed it but about three to six months ideally, and lots of uncertainty in that, but then to see at which point we can actually get back to normal.\"\n\nBut Dr Harries also said it was \"plausible\" that it could further than that.\n\nOn the number of deaths from the virus, she added: \"We actually anticipate our numbers will get worse over the next week, possibly two, and then we are looking to see whether we have managed to push that curve down and we start to see a decline.\"\n\n\n\nBBC News Special | Coronavirus Daily Update UK PM | BBC\n\n#BBC #BBCiPlayer #BBCNews #BBCCoronavirus #Coronavirus #Covid19 #CoronavirusOutbreak #Corona #CoronavirusUK\n\nAll our TV channels and S4C are available to watch live through BBC iPlayer, although some programmes may not be available to stream online due to rights.
