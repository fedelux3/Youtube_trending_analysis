      "description": "The Marsh family sharing their lockdown-themed coronavirus pandemic in the style of Les Mis\u00e9rables.\n\nThe Marsh Family's One Day More, lyrics:\n\nOne day more, another day another destiny,Shopping for online delivery,I\u2019ve tried again, only to find there\u2019s nothing til September timeOne day more\u2026\nI had a football match today, How can I play when we are parted?One day more\u2026Our grandparents are miles away, They can\u2019t work Skype! We\u2019re brokenhearted,\nOne more day all on my phone, Will we ever meet again? Will we ever meet our friends?One more selfie with me glaring, I am bored of being with you, Not long till the data\u2019s blown,So we swear until we\u2019re blue, But they never let me share\nOne more day of \u201conline school\u201d Do we get a change of clothes? Teachers fill up Google classroom, Have you seen my brother\u2019s hair?!Our exams have all been pulled,Do I change my underwear? And we\u2019re sharing a bathroom,\nThe time is now, the day is here, one day more\u2026 One more day\u2019s home education, Let\u2019s just let them run amuck, We\u2019re not ready for these schoolboys, \u2018Cos they just don\u2019t give a f***\nOne day more\u2026Watch our daddy drink, see our mummy sigh, Clapping for the NHS can make \u2018em cry,Here\u2019s a little walk, there\u2019s a little ride, Sunshine\u2019s such a bummer when we\u2019re stuck inside\nOne day to a new beginning,Make some respirators now!Every man will need vaccines,That\u2019s a little bit sexist! There\u2019s a new world to be winning, There\u2019s a new world to be won\nDo you hear the people sing?My pizza\u2019s here, I eat with you! One day more\u2026We will join the people\u2019s heroes we will phone those left alone We will volunteer to help out, we will grow what we can grow\nOne day more\u2026Tomorrow we\u2019ll be far away, tomorrow is the judgement day, Tomorrow we\u2019ll discover what Tesco online has got in store, One more dawn, One more day, One day more!"

Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! \n\nOn this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes \u201cgimmicky\u201d golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. \n\nIf you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video."
