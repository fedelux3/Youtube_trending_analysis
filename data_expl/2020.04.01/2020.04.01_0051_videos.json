I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

      "description": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is cracking down on cross-country travel by imposing new restrictions on domestic travel. As Abigail Bimman reports, while Trudeau said Canadians' efforts are helping to curb the spread, more still needs to be done. \n\nMeanwhile, Jennifer Johnson reports on the staggering statistics that reveal one person is dying every 17 minutes in New York, as the U.S. scrambles to source medical supplies to slow the spread of the pandemic.\n\nEurope has passed two grim COVID-19 milestones, after the continent reported twenty thousand deaths linked to the virus, half of which occurred in Italy. As Redmond Shannon explains, while several countries have already imposed lockdowns, these measures are expected to become even more severe. \n\nThe Bank of Canada dropped its key lending rate in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a nationwide drop in mortgage rates. As Robin Gill reports, the pandemic is forcing realtors to adapt to cooling sales in recently hot markets. \n\nAs the world responds to the COVID-19 pandemic, people around the world are adjusting to the strict social distancing measures imposed, including self-isolation. Reggie Cecchini looks at how people are passing the time. \n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/6745733/trudeau-coronavirus-update-march-28/\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\r\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\r\nFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\r\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\r\n#GlobalNews #cdnpoli #COVID19 #Coronavirus"

      "description": "Paid sick leave keeps everyone healthier. During a pandemic, it's a necessity.\n\nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nIn most developed countries, workers have the right to a certain number of paid sick days. It\u2019s a policy that isn\u2019t rooted in just generosity \u2014 during pandemics like the novel coronavirus, it can literally save lives. \n\nWhen workers have to choose between earning a living and staying home sick, it incentivizes them to come to work when they're ill, and potentially infect their colleagues and anyone else they come into contact with. That\u2019s why public health officials are concerned that millions of American workers don\u2019t have access to paid sick days. And a disproportionate share of those workers are concentrated in occupations like food service and hospitality, where there\u2019s potential to infect the hundreds of customers many of them interact with every day.\n\nCorrection: At 1:18, islands in Canada, Denmark, Japan, Italy, and Australia are missing highlights.\n\nPrevious headline: One policy that changes the coronavirus math\n\nFurther reading:\nThe Italian Ministry of Health \nhttps://www.thelocal.it/20200309/map-which-parts-of-italy-are-affected-by-coronavirus-outbreak\n\nWorld Health Organization\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic#/media/File:2020_coronavirus_cases_outside_China.svg\n\nCenter for Economic and Policy Research\nhttps://media.milanote.com/p/files/1Jcvmg1vhFTY82/Rt8/CEPR%20-%20paid%20sick%20leave%20in%2022%20countries%20%282020%20update%29.pdf\n\nPew Research Center\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html\n\nA Better Balance\nhttps://www.abetterbalance.org/resources/map-of-paid-sick-time-laws/\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel\nhttp://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/33874059.html\n\nWisconsin State Legislature\nhttps://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/sb23\n\nPR Watch\nhttps://www.prwatch.org/files/ALEC%20Labor%20Business%20Reg%20Subcttee%20Annual%20Mtg%202011.pdf#8\n\nEconomic Policy Institute\nhttps://www.epi.org/preemption-map/\n\nHouse Democrats (via CNN)\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/politics/coronavirus-house-economic-bill/index.html\n\nUS House of Representatives\nhttps://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20200309/BILLS-116hr6201-SUS.pdf\n\nThe New York Times\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-paid-sick-leave.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

The stock turbo looks broken, the intake doesn't work, the dump pipe is wrecked, the bolts all seized. The car doesn't run very well but with some mad new aftermarket parts, the MR2 is going to be reborn ready to battle Moog's MOON Buggy!\n\nMore info on NGK Spark Plug part finder: https://www.ngk.com.au/products/spark-plugs/\nGFB Fuel Pressure Regulator: https://gfb.com.au/products/fuel-management-products/\nCT21 Turbo: http://www.atsracing.net/Parts/Details/TUR-BLACKJACK\n\nSpecial thanks to DK Imports & Raceworks\n\nShop: http://www.mightycarmods.com/collections/\r\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/mightycarmods\r\nForum: http://forums.mightycarmods.com\r\n\r\nAlso something to note around Mighty Car Mods: we are normal guys and are not trained mechanics.

      "description": "Find your DREAM car on AutoTempest!\u25bahttps://bit.ly/CarTrekAT2\nThanks to AutoTempest.com for sponsoring this series!\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nOn today's episode of Car Trek, AutoTempest challenged the guys to fix their aging exotic cars themselves. While Tavarish is a human wrench, Tyler and Ed aren't so inclined. The Ferrari 360 needs some serious un-pimping, the Lamborghini Gallardo is a total basket case that can't take any fuel without spilling it, and the Aston Martin is full of surprises. This is going to be fun.
