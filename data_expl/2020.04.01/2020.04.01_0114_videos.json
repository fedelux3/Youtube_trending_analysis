      "description": "Italy has set another record for the most deaths from coronavirus in a single day. Nearly 1,000 people have died in the last 24 hours, bringing the total death toll to over 9,000. That's the highest number of any country, and health officials say the worst may be yet to come. Hospital wards are still full, although doctors say the number of patients is now steadying. Contagion rates appear to be slowing, giving hope that the strict social controls may be working. But the lockdown is hitting the Italian economy hard, with churches and charities struggling to care for people in need of basic supplies. As Italy marked its deadliest day of the pandemic, Pope Francis held a special service in Rome to pray for an end to the suffering. In a historic first, he performed the \"Urbi et Orbi\" blessing to an empty Saint Peter's Square.\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\r\nFollow DW on social media:\r\n\u25baFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\r\n\u25baTwitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\r\n\u25baInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dw_stories/\r\nF\u00fcr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/deutschewelle\n#Coronavirus #Covid19 #CoronaUpdate"

The stock turbo looks broken, the intake doesn't work, the dump pipe is wrecked, the bolts all seized. The car doesn't run very well but with some mad new aftermarket parts, the MR2 is going to be reborn ready to battle Moog's MOON Buggy!\n\nMore info on NGK Spark Plug part finder: https://www.ngk.com.au/products/spark-plugs/\nGFB Fuel Pressure Regulator: https://gfb.com.au/products/fuel-management-products/\nCT21 Turbo: http://www.atsracing.net/Parts/Details/TUR-BLACKJACK\n\nSpecial thanks to DK Imports & Raceworks\n\nShop: http://www.mightycarmods.com/collections/\r\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/mightycarmods\r\nForum: http://forums.mightycarmods.com\r\n\r\nAlso something to note around Mighty Car Mods: we are normal guys and are not trained mechanics. We like to make interesting car mods and show you how we've gone about it, but we can't promise that anything we show you will work for your particular car, or that you won't harm yourself, someone else, your car or your warranty doing it. Please be safe, be responsible and unless you know what you're doing, do not fool around with very serious machinery just because you've seen us make it look so easy. Talk to a qualified mechanic if you are in any doubt.."

      "description": "MADRID -- Before the outbreak in Spain began, the only people who went in and out of the small hospital where Alfonso Molina Moreno works as a nurse were visitors, staffers, and cleaning crews. Patients come to Hospital La Fuenfria for long-term, palliative care and Moreno, who has worked as a nurse for 16 years, found a sense of purpose in bringing them care and company at the end of their lives. \n\nNow, he and his colleagues worry that they\u2019re doing harm. A few days before we spoke, patients at the facility started testing positive for COVID-19. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where it came from,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether we, the staff, brought it here. We don\u2019t know whether it was due to the patients\u2019 visitors. We don\u2019t know the source.\u201d \n\nThe hospital has cut off all visits. Staffers now take exhaustive precautions when working with patients who have tested positive\u2014putting on protective equipment they dispose of in contaminated rooms and washing their hands on both sides of the door. \n\nBut there\u2019s still a degree of uncertainty. When we spoke, Morena hadn\u2019t been tested, and Spain\u2019s health ministry says health workers currently make up nearly 14-percent of positive cases. Now, as the country scrambles to contain the virus it\u2019s ordered 640,000 test kits from China and Korea in an effort to screen health workers and the most vulnerable. The hope is that this will help identify people who need to self-isolate. \n\nMorena isn\u2019t just thinking of the patients he\u2019s now caring for. He\u2019s worried about how long the virus was in the hospital. After a patient with cervical cancer died, a post-mortem X-ray showed her lungs had advanced, bilateral pneumonia. \u201cIt could have been coronavirus, right? She wasn\u2019t tested,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s like, oh my God, to what extent\u2014let\u2019s see, this needs a pinch of salt but\u2014what if it was me? That's it. So I can\u2019t hide it, because you really don\u2019t know. Even with all the security measures in place, you still don\u2019t know.\u201d \n\nLike everyone working despite an outbreak, Morena worries about infecting his loved ones. \u201cI told this to my colleagues, and we have this kind of sharing moment. We're all going through this bad phase, this suffering.\u201d But he isn\u2019t thinking about quitting. \u201cI really find myself fortunate to be able to work because I have the chance to go and feel useful,\u201d he says. He\u2019s even volunteered to take on more shifts. \u201cThe healthcare providers, at this moment, we have to be there no matter what. Because if it is not us, who will it be then? There is no one else.\u201d \n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\n\n#VICENews #News"

During a pandemic, it's a necessity.\n\nBecome a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab\n\nIn most developed countries, workers have the right to a certain number of paid sick days. It\u2019s a policy that isn\u2019t rooted in just generosity \u2014 during pandemics like the novel coronavirus, it can literally save lives. \n\nWhen workers have to choose between earning a living and staying home sick, it incentivizes them to come to work when they're ill, and potentially infect their colleagues and anyone else they come into contact with. That\u2019s why public health officials are concerned that millions of American workers don\u2019t have access to paid sick days. And a disproportionate share of those workers are concentrated in occupations like food service and hospitality, where there\u2019s potential to infect the hundreds of customers many of them interact with every day.\n\nCorrection: At 1:18, islands in Canada, Denmark, Japan, Italy, and Australia are missing highlights.\n\nPrevious headline: One policy that changes the coronavirus math\n\nFurther reading:\nThe Italian Ministry of Health \nhttps://www.thelocal.it/20200309/map-which-parts-of-italy-are-affected-by-coronavirus-outbreak\n\nWorld Health Organization\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic#/media/File:2020_coronavirus_cases_outside_China.svg\n\nCenter for Economic and Policy Research\nhttps://media.milanote.com/p/files/1Jcvmg1vhFTY82/Rt8/CEPR%20-%20paid%20sick%20leave%20in%2022%20countries%20%282020%20update%29.pdf\n\nPew Research Center\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html\n\nA Better Balance\nhttps://www.abetterbalance.org/resources/map-of-paid-sick-time-laws/\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel\nhttp://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/33874059.html\n\nWisconsin State Legislature\nhttps://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/sb23\n\nPR Watch\nhttps://www.prwatch.org/files/ALEC%20Labor%20Business%20Reg%20Subcttee%20Annual%20Mtg%202011.pdf#8\n\nEconomic Policy Institute\nhttps://www.epi.org/preemption-map/\n\nHouse Democrats (via CNN)\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/politics/coronavirus-house-economic-bill/index.html\n\nUS House of Representatives\nhttps://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20200309/BILLS-116hr6201-SUS.pdf\n\nThe New York Times\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-paid-sick-leave.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
