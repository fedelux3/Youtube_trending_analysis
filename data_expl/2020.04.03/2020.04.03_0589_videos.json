      "description": "Never Miss A Film Theory! \u25ba http://bit.ly/1dI8VBH   \n\nThe new Sonic movie is FULL of hidden gems, the most important of which has to be how ADORABLE the redesign of Sonic ended up. That's not the point of this theory, though. No, today I am focusing on one key detail from the movie - Sonic's shoes. Specifically, the fact that Sonic seems to keep ruining them. You see, this detail says something VERY important about the way Sonic runs. What is that?

      "description": "Country music fans lost a legend on March 20, 2020, when singer-songwriter Kenny Rogers died at age 81. Fans and celebrities alike paid tribute to the icon, including the Texas native's longtime friend and collaborator, Dolly Parton. Parton wrote on Instagram,\n\n\"You never know how much you love somebody until they're gone. I've had so many wonderful years and wonderful times with my friend Kenny, but above all the music and the success I loved him as a wonderful man and a true friend.\" \n\nFellow country star Reba McEntire commented on her post, quote, \"Dolly, he sure loved you.\"\n\nNot only did Rogers and Parton share a lot of love, they also worked together on various projects. From the duo's 1985 concert film, Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton: Together, to their hits like \"Islands in the Stream,\" they were an unstoppable force. In fact, the two were so in sync that relationship rumors dogged them for years.\n\nSome might assume this topic was uncomfortable for Rogers' five ex-wives, some of whom spoke out after the country crooner's passing. This includes Marianne Gordon, Rogers' fourth wife and mother to his son, Christopher Cody Rogers.\n\nMarianne Gordon, an actor, was married to Kenny Rogers from 1977 to 1993. During this time, Gordon got to know the country legend on a deep level, especially where it concerned his close friendship with Dolly Parton. When asked by Closer Weekly about the romance rumors on March 24, shortly after Rogers' death, she replied, \n\n\"I never felt uncomfortable at all. I just knew him so well. But, it's funny that you say that. We had a tennis pro who traveled with us, Doug Dean asked me too. I told him Kenny said I like her as a friend and we have a great thing on stage. We'd lose it. There is sexual tension and teasing each other and it would screw it up.\"\n\nAlthough Gordon is pretty sure nothing happened between the collaborators, she doesn't rule it out. She added,\n\n\"Dolly might have [made a move though]. It's entered my mind because she always said she thought like a man. I don't mean it badly. Dolly is a fun girl.\"\n\nFor those who might not believe Marianne Gordon's account of Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers' relationship, they should probably take note of a 2013 interview the two did with ABC News. When asked directly whether they were an item at one point, the \"Jolene\" singer replied, \n\n\"It never crossed our minds because he was with people. I've been married, forty, I've been with my husband 48 years.\"\n\nRogers joked, \n\n\"I think that chemistry and that connection comes from an unrequited love, if you will, because we never consummated anything.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, the pair's story begins and ends with friendship. Parton told CMT's Cody Alan in 2017,\n\n\"Kenny's friendship means more to me than our hit records. Actually, we're kind of like soul mates. He's from Texas and I'm from Tennessee. There's an old famous country song, 'T for Texas, T for Tennessee.' We always sing that to each other.\" \n\nShe added, \n\n\"I love his singing. I love his voice. I never tire of hearing him sing. And I think our voices blend great, so I'm really proud of the musical part of that as well.\"\n\nOf course, it's completely reasonable to have a platonic soulmate. And we think this perfectly explains why Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers never dated.\n\nWatch the video to see What Kenny Rogers' Ex-Wife Has To Say About Dolly Parton.\n\n#DollyParton #KennyRogers #RIPKennyRogers\n\nRead Full Article: https://www.nickiswift.com/198211/what-kenny-rogers-ex-wife-has-to-say-about-dolly-parton/"

This time, these two guys who have always hosted and always will host Gourmet Makes are attempting to make a gourmet version of Andes Cr\u00e8me De Menthe, America's favorite after dinner mint. Strangely, one of our editors had the idea that Claire Saffitz had always been the host of Gourmet Makes though they couldn't point to a single episode that Claire had hosted. We're all very worried about the editor, because as we all know, Chris and Brad ARE Gourmet Makes.\r\nFollow Brad on Instagram: @bradleone\r\nAnd Chris too: @moroccochris\r\nFilmed on 2/24/20.\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?
