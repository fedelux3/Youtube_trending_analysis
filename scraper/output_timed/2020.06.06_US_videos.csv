Falcon 9’s first stage previously supported the Telstar 18 VANTAGE mission in September 2018, the Iridium-8 mission in January 2019, and two separate Starlink missions in May 2019 and in January 2020. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Just Read the Instructions” droneship, which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. The Starlink satellites will deploy in an elliptical orbit approximately 15 minutes after liftoff. Prior to orbit raise, SpaceX engineers will conduct data reviews to ensure all Starlink satellites are operating as intended. Once the checkouts are complete, the satellites will then use their onboard ion thrusters to move into their intended orbits and operational altitude of 550 km."

Discretion is advised. Protesters took to the streets on Monday in Washington, D.C. just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the nation on the ongoing protests rocking many U.S. states.  In his televised remarks, Trump said a 7 p.m. curfew would be “strictly enforced” within Washington D.C. as well, promising lengthy jail sentences and severe criminal penalties for anyone caught breaking the law.According to The Associated Press, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were now being sent to assist the U.S. capital, citing senior defence officials.Earlier on Monday, Trump had mocked the nation’s governors as “weak,” demanding that they enforce tougher crackdowns and more arrests in their states amid another night of violent protest in several American cities.The protests, which were sparked by the death of George Floyd — a Black man who died of suffocation after a video showed a white Minneapolis police officer with a knee on Floyd’s neck — have now entered their second week.MORE: http://globalnews.ca/news/7011316/trump-governors-george-floyd-protesters/For more info, please go to http://www.globalnews.caSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#GeorgeFloydProtests #GlobalNews #WashingtonDCProtestCurfew"

Justice for George Floyd protests sparked after video surfaced showing George Floyd’s killing by a Minneapolis police officer.Protests erupted nationwide days after Floyd’s death calling for the arrests of all the officers involved after a Memorial Day viral video showed Floyd being pinned down by his neck by then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Floyd, who is repeatedly heard in the video saying he can't breath and asking for Chauvin to get off his neck, died that day.The Minneapolis mayor on Tuesday fired all four officers involved in the incident. On Friday, Chauvin was arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. But the other three officers who were involved in the incident have not yet been arrested or charged, with prosecutors in Minnesota on Friday saying that charges are likely forthcoming.D.C. and Manassas are among cities across the nation who held protests Friday night demanding the remaining three officers involved in Floyd's death to be arrested and charged.For more on the protests and riots learn more here: https://bit.ly/2ZQhNQR"

Black Lives Matter Cleveland is holding a rally in downtown Cleveland to call for justice following the death of George Floyd at the hands of four police officers earlier this week in Minneapolis.“Every breath we take is precious, especially during this time,” Black Lives Matter Cleveland officials said in a press release. “To see the life choked out of our kindred brother #GeorgeFloyd as horrific and horrendous as it was, it’s a constant reminder that the color of our skin will always be weaponized against us. It’s a constant reminder that black lives don’t matter in America when you are presumed to be a criminal.”The group is asking for others to come support their call for justice at the FREE stamp. The demonstration is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m."
