Falcon 9 will lift off from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. A backup opportunity is available on Thursday, June 4 at 9:03 p.m. EDT, 1:03 UTC on June 5. Falcon 9’s first stage previously supported the Telstar 18 VANTAGE mission in September 2018, the Iridium-8 mission in January 2019, and two separate Starlink missions in May 2019 and in January 2020. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Just Read the Instructions” droneship, which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. The Starlink satellites will deploy in an elliptical orbit approximately 15 minutes after liftoff. Prior to orbit raise, SpaceX engineers will conduct data reviews to ensure all Starlink satellites are operating as intended. Once the checkouts are complete, the satellites will then use their onboard ion thrusters to move into their intended orbits and operational altitude of 550 km."

Andrew Cuomo blasted the city's response as a disgrace and accused the mayor and the NYPD of failing to do their jobs Tuesday night.I believe the mayor underestimates the scope of the problem. I think he underestimates the duration of the problem, Cuomo said Tuesday, adding he thought more cops should've been deployed on top of the already doubled patrol."

Discretion is advised. Protesters took to the streets on Monday in Washington, D.C. just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the nation on the ongoing protests rocking many U.S. states.  In his televised remarks, Trump said a 7 p.m. curfew would be “strictly enforced” within Washington D.C. as well, promising lengthy jail sentences and severe criminal penalties for anyone caught breaking the law.According to The Associated Press, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were now being sent to assist the U.S. capital, citing senior defence officials.Earlier on Monday, Trump had mocked the nation’s governors as “weak,” demanding that they enforce tougher crackdowns and more arrests in their states amid another night of violent protest in several American cities.The protests, which were sparked by the death of George Floyd — a Black man who died of suffocation after a video showed a white Minneapolis police officer with a knee on Floyd’s neck — have now entered their second week.MORE: http://globalnews.ca/news/7011316/trump-governors-george-floyd-protesters/For more info, please go to http://www.globalnews.caSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#GeorgeFloydProtests #GlobalNews #WashingtonDCProtestCurfew"

Justice for George Floyd protests sparked after video surfaced showing George Floyd’s killing by a Minneapolis police officer.Protests erupted nationwide days after Floyd’s death calling for the arrests of all the officers involved after a Memorial Day viral video showed Floyd being pinned down by his neck by then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Floyd, who is repeatedly heard in the video saying he can't breath and asking for Chauvin to get off his neck, died that day.The Minneapolis mayor on Tuesday fired all four officers involved in the incident. On Friday, Chauvin was arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. But the other three officers who were involved in the incident have not yet been arrested or charged, with prosecutors in Minnesota on Friday saying that charges are likely forthcoming.D.C. and Manassas are among cities across the nation who held protests Friday night demanding the remaining three officers involved in Floyd's death to be arrested and charged.For more on the protests and riots learn more here: https://bit.ly/2ZQhNQR"

But with a great campaign to reduce the spread of infection, in the middle of May 2020, Thailand re-opened its restaurants and street food stalls for sit down, dining in customers - under certain regulations and guidelines. The main rule is that it’s one person per table, unless you have some kind of a barrier on the table. And street food vendors have become very creative to have cardboard or plastic shields to divide tables. Thai street food in 2020 - I wanted to go out and experience the social distance dining regulations in Bangkok for my self - so we my wife and I headed to Yaowarat, which is Bangkok’s Chinatown - known for its vibrant street food culture. Most street food stalls were open for evening service, but it was still very quiet compared to normal, maybe 15% of the action and energy and customers that would typically be there. Even though sit down customers are now permitted, many Thai street food stalls in Bangkok have taken to using apps for delivery. Here are the places and food we ate: Kuay Tiew Muay Zaa (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวหมวยซ่าาส์) - This is a noodle stall restaurant in the middle of Sampeng Market. I had never been here before, but just stopped in as it was a convenient location. I orderecd their Tom Yum Noodles (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวต้มยำ), which was pretty decently good, filled with a variety of fish balls. Ying had the yen ta fo (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวเย็นตาโฟ).Price - 40 THB (1.26 USD) per bowl Bitter Liquid (น้ำขม) Krua Porn La Mai (ครัวพรละมัย) - This is a legendary well known Thai street food stall in Chinatown, known for their flaming on iron skillets filled with a variety of different dishes. They set up tables with increased social distances, spacing out the tables, and with plastic sheet barriers between diners at each table. We ordered Suki (สุกี้น้ำไก่), Fried Noodles (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่กรอบ), and finally Oyster Omelet (หอยทอด).Total price - 230 THB (7.22 USD) Pa Tong Go Savoey (ปาท่องโก๋เสวย) - Finally, we ended this Thai street food tour in 2020 with Thai Chinese style pa tong go, or youtiou savory fried dough. It was delicious, this is one of the best places, featured in the Michelin Guide. Pa Tong Go (ปาท่องโก๋) - 70 THB. And that completes this Thai street food tour in 2020 in Bangkok, Thailand. Overall, most people wear masks, and many street food vendors have added plastic sheet shields to their cooking and food displays. Additionally, especially in busier areas of Bangkok, street food tables have a blockade between customers. Hope you’re doing well, having a great day, and keeping safe.

They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks.”Trump has seized on protests against police brutality toward people of color to portray himself as an icon of law and order eschewing the soothing role past presidents have adopted in similar moments as he seeks to turn the election-year conversation from his widely criticized handling of the coronavirus outbreak.On the Monday call, Trump delivered his most strident message yet as cities across the country impose curfews and governors deploy the National Guard to try to head off another destructive evening. Many other peaceful protests also are underway mourning the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and demanding an end of police violence directed at African Americans and other minorities.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:Follow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktakeLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktakeFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktakeSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.comQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders."

Falcon 9 will lift off from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. A backup opportunity is available on Thursday, June 4 at 9:03 p.m. EDT, 1:03 UTC on June 5. Falcon 9’s first stage previously supported the Telstar 18 VANTAGE mission in September 2018, the Iridium-8 mission in January 2019, and two separate Starlink missions in May 2019 and in January 2020. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Just Read the Instructions” droneship, which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. The Starlink satellites will deploy in an elliptical orbit approximately 15 minutes after liftoff. Prior to orbit raise, SpaceX engineers will conduct data reviews to ensure all Starlink satellites are operating as intended. Once the checkouts are complete, the satellites will then use their onboard ion thrusters to move into their intended orbits and operational altitude of 550 km."

Andrew Cuomo blasted the city's response as a disgrace and accused the mayor and the NYPD of failing to do their jobs Tuesday night.I believe the mayor underestimates the scope of the problem. I think he underestimates the duration of the problem, Cuomo said Tuesday, adding he thought more cops should've been deployed on top of the already doubled patrol."

Discretion is advised. Protesters took to the streets on Monday in Washington, D.C. just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the nation on the ongoing protests rocking many U.S. states.  In his televised remarks, Trump said a 7 p.m. curfew would be “strictly enforced” within Washington D.C. as well, promising lengthy jail sentences and severe criminal penalties for anyone caught breaking the law.According to The Associated Press, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were now being sent to assist the U.S. capital, citing senior defence officials.Earlier on Monday, Trump had mocked the nation’s governors as “weak,” demanding that they enforce tougher crackdowns and more arrests in their states amid another night of violent protest in several American cities.The protests, which were sparked by the death of George Floyd — a Black man who died of suffocation after a video showed a white Minneapolis police officer with a knee on Floyd’s neck — have now entered their second week.MORE: http://globalnews.ca/news/7011316/trump-governors-george-floyd-protesters/For more info, please go to http://www.globalnews.caSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#GeorgeFloydProtests #GlobalNews #WashingtonDCProtestCurfew"

Justice for George Floyd protests sparked after video surfaced showing George Floyd’s killing by a Minneapolis police officer.Protests erupted nationwide days after Floyd’s death calling for the arrests of all the officers involved after a Memorial Day viral video showed Floyd being pinned down by his neck by then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Floyd, who is repeatedly heard in the video saying he can't breath and asking for Chauvin to get off his neck, died that day.The Minneapolis mayor on Tuesday fired all four officers involved in the incident. On Friday, Chauvin was arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. But the other three officers who were involved in the incident have not yet been arrested or charged, with prosecutors in Minnesota on Friday saying that charges are likely forthcoming.D.C. and Manassas are among cities across the nation who held protests Friday night demanding the remaining three officers involved in Floyd's death to be arrested and charged.For more on the protests and riots learn more here: https://bit.ly/2ZQhNQR"

But with a great campaign to reduce the spread of infection, in the middle of May 2020, Thailand re-opened its restaurants and street food stalls for sit down, dining in customers - under certain regulations and guidelines. The main rule is that it’s one person per table, unless you have some kind of a barrier on the table. And street food vendors have become very creative to have cardboard or plastic shields to divide tables. Thai street food in 2020 - I wanted to go out and experience the social distance dining regulations in Bangkok for my self - so we my wife and I headed to Yaowarat, which is Bangkok’s Chinatown - known for its vibrant street food culture. Most street food stalls were open for evening service, but it was still very quiet compared to normal, maybe 15% of the action and energy and customers that would typically be there. Even though sit down customers are now permitted, many Thai street food stalls in Bangkok have taken to using apps for delivery. Here are the places and food we ate: Kuay Tiew Muay Zaa (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวหมวยซ่าาส์) - This is a noodle stall restaurant in the middle of Sampeng Market. I had never been here before, but just stopped in as it was a convenient location. I orderecd their Tom Yum Noodles (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวต้มยำ), which was pretty decently good, filled with a variety of fish balls. Ying had the yen ta fo (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวเย็นตาโฟ).Price - 40 THB (1.26 USD) per bowl Bitter Liquid (น้ำขม) Krua Porn La Mai (ครัวพรละมัย) - This is a legendary well known Thai street food stall in Chinatown, known for their flaming on iron skillets filled with a variety of different dishes. They set up tables with increased social distances, spacing out the tables, and with plastic sheet barriers between diners at each table. We ordered Suki (สุกี้น้ำไก่), Fried Noodles (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่กรอบ), and finally Oyster Omelet (หอยทอด).Total price - 230 THB (7.22 USD) Pa Tong Go Savoey (ปาท่องโก๋เสวย) - Finally, we ended this Thai street food tour in 2020 with Thai Chinese style pa tong go, or youtiou savory fried dough. It was delicious, this is one of the best places, featured in the Michelin Guide. Pa Tong Go (ปาท่องโก๋) - 70 THB. And that completes this Thai street food tour in 2020 in Bangkok, Thailand. Overall, most people wear masks, and many street food vendors have added plastic sheet shields to their cooking and food displays. Additionally, especially in busier areas of Bangkok, street food tables have a blockade between customers. Hope you’re doing well, having a great day, and keeping safe.

The arrival of Hurley and Behnken expanded the Expedition crew on board the orbital outpost.

They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks.”Trump has seized on protests against police brutality toward people of color to portray himself as an icon of law and order eschewing the soothing role past presidents have adopted in similar moments as he seeks to turn the election-year conversation from his widely criticized handling of the coronavirus outbreak.On the Monday call, Trump delivered his most strident message yet as cities across the country impose curfews and governors deploy the National Guard to try to head off another destructive evening. Many other peaceful protests also are underway mourning the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and demanding an end of police violence directed at African Americans and other minorities.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:Follow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktakeLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktakeFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktakeSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.comQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders."

Falcon 9 will lift off from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. A backup opportunity is available on Thursday, June 4 at 9:03 p.m. EDT, 1:03 UTC on June 5. Falcon 9’s first stage previously supported the Telstar 18 VANTAGE mission in September 2018, the Iridium-8 mission in January 2019, and two separate Starlink missions in May 2019 and in January 2020. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Just Read the Instructions” droneship, which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. The Starlink satellites will deploy in an elliptical orbit approximately 15 minutes after liftoff. Prior to orbit raise, SpaceX engineers will conduct data reviews to ensure all Starlink satellites are operating as intended. Once the checkouts are complete, the satellites will then use their onboard ion thrusters to move into their intended orbits and operational altitude of 550 km."

Andrew Cuomo blasted the city's response as a disgrace and accused the mayor and the NYPD of failing to do their jobs Tuesday night.I believe the mayor underestimates the scope of the problem. I think he underestimates the duration of the problem, Cuomo said Tuesday, adding he thought more cops should've been deployed on top of the already doubled patrol."

Discretion is advised. Protesters took to the streets on Monday in Washington, D.C. just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the nation on the ongoing protests rocking many U.S. states.  In his televised remarks, Trump said a 7 p.m. curfew would be “strictly enforced” within Washington D.C. as well, promising lengthy jail sentences and severe criminal penalties for anyone caught breaking the law.According to The Associated Press, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were now being sent to assist the U.S. capital, citing senior defence officials.Earlier on Monday, Trump had mocked the nation’s governors as “weak,” demanding that they enforce tougher crackdowns and more arrests in their states amid another night of violent protest in several American cities.The protests, which were sparked by the death of George Floyd — a Black man who died of suffocation after a video showed a white Minneapolis police officer with a knee on Floyd’s neck — have now entered their second week.MORE: http://globalnews.ca/news/7011316/trump-governors-george-floyd-protesters/For more info, please go to http://www.globalnews.caSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#GeorgeFloydProtests #GlobalNews #WashingtonDCProtestCurfew"

Justice for George Floyd protests sparked after video surfaced showing George Floyd’s killing by a Minneapolis police officer.Protests erupted nationwide days after Floyd’s death calling for the arrests of all the officers involved after a Memorial Day viral video showed Floyd being pinned down by his neck by then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Floyd, who is repeatedly heard in the video saying he can't breath and asking for Chauvin to get off his neck, died that day.The Minneapolis mayor on Tuesday fired all four officers involved in the incident. On Friday, Chauvin was arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. But the other three officers who were involved in the incident have not yet been arrested or charged, with prosecutors in Minnesota on Friday saying that charges are likely forthcoming.D.C. and Manassas are among cities across the nation who held protests Friday night demanding the remaining three officers involved in Floyd's death to be arrested and charged.For more on the protests and riots learn more here: https://bit.ly/2ZQhNQR"

But with a great campaign to reduce the spread of infection, in the middle of May 2020, Thailand re-opened its restaurants and street food stalls for sit down, dining in customers - under certain regulations and guidelines. The main rule is that it’s one person per table, unless you have some kind of a barrier on the table. And street food vendors have become very creative to have cardboard or plastic shields to divide tables. Thai street food in 2020 - I wanted to go out and experience the social distance dining regulations in Bangkok for my self - so we my wife and I headed to Yaowarat, which is Bangkok’s Chinatown - known for its vibrant street food culture. Most street food stalls were open for evening service, but it was still very quiet compared to normal, maybe 15% of the action and energy and customers that would typically be there. Even though sit down customers are now permitted, many Thai street food stalls in Bangkok have taken to using apps for delivery. Here are the places and food we ate: Kuay Tiew Muay Zaa (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวหมวยซ่าาส์) - This is a noodle stall restaurant in the middle of Sampeng Market. I had never been here before, but just stopped in as it was a convenient location. I orderecd their Tom Yum Noodles (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวต้มยำ), which was pretty decently good, filled with a variety of fish balls. Ying had the yen ta fo (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวเย็นตาโฟ).Price - 40 THB (1.26 USD) per bowl Bitter Liquid (น้ำขม) Krua Porn La Mai (ครัวพรละมัย) - This is a legendary well known Thai street food stall in Chinatown, known for their flaming on iron skillets filled with a variety of different dishes. They set up tables with increased social distances, spacing out the tables, and with plastic sheet barriers between diners at each table. We ordered Suki (สุกี้น้ำไก่), Fried Noodles (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่กรอบ), and finally Oyster Omelet (หอยทอด).Total price - 230 THB (7.22 USD) Pa Tong Go Savoey (ปาท่องโก๋เสวย) - Finally, we ended this Thai street food tour in 2020 with Thai Chinese style pa tong go, or youtiou savory fried dough. It was delicious, this is one of the best places, featured in the Michelin Guide. Pa Tong Go (ปาท่องโก๋) - 70 THB. And that completes this Thai street food tour in 2020 in Bangkok, Thailand. Overall, most people wear masks, and many street food vendors have added plastic sheet shields to their cooking and food displays. Additionally, especially in busier areas of Bangkok, street food tables have a blockade between customers. Hope you’re doing well, having a great day, and keeping safe.

The arrival of Hurley and Behnken expanded the Expedition crew on board the orbital outpost.

They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks.”Trump has seized on protests against police brutality toward people of color to portray himself as an icon of law and order eschewing the soothing role past presidents have adopted in similar moments as he seeks to turn the election-year conversation from his widely criticized handling of the coronavirus outbreak.On the Monday call, Trump delivered his most strident message yet as cities across the country impose curfews and governors deploy the National Guard to try to head off another destructive evening. Many other peaceful protests also are underway mourning the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and demanding an end of police violence directed at African Americans and other minorities.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:Follow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktakeLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktakeFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktakeSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.comQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders."

Falcon 9 will lift off from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. A backup opportunity is available on Thursday, June 4 at 9:03 p.m. EDT, 1:03 UTC on June 5. Falcon 9’s first stage previously supported the Telstar 18 VANTAGE mission in September 2018, the Iridium-8 mission in January 2019, and two separate Starlink missions in May 2019 and in January 2020. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Just Read the Instructions” droneship, which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. The Starlink satellites will deploy in an elliptical orbit approximately 15 minutes after liftoff. Prior to orbit raise, SpaceX engineers will conduct data reviews to ensure all Starlink satellites are operating as intended. Once the checkouts are complete, the satellites will then use their onboard ion thrusters to move into their intended orbits and operational altitude of 550 km."

Andrew Cuomo blasted the city's response as a disgrace and accused the mayor and the NYPD of failing to do their jobs Tuesday night.I believe the mayor underestimates the scope of the problem. I think he underestimates the duration of the problem, Cuomo said Tuesday, adding he thought more cops should've been deployed on top of the already doubled patrol."

Discretion is advised. Protesters took to the streets on Monday in Washington, D.C. just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the nation on the ongoing protests rocking many U.S. states.  In his televised remarks, Trump said a 7 p.m. curfew would be “strictly enforced” within Washington D.C. as well, promising lengthy jail sentences and severe criminal penalties for anyone caught breaking the law.According to The Associated Press, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were now being sent to assist the U.S. capital, citing senior defence officials.Earlier on Monday, Trump had mocked the nation’s governors as “weak,” demanding that they enforce tougher crackdowns and more arrests in their states amid another night of violent protest in several American cities.The protests, which were sparked by the death of George Floyd — a Black man who died of suffocation after a video showed a white Minneapolis police officer with a knee on Floyd’s neck — have now entered their second week.MORE: http://globalnews.ca/news/7011316/trump-governors-george-floyd-protesters/For more info, please go to http://www.globalnews.caSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#GeorgeFloydProtests #GlobalNews #WashingtonDCProtestCurfew"

Justice for George Floyd protests sparked after video surfaced showing George Floyd’s killing by a Minneapolis police officer.Protests erupted nationwide days after Floyd’s death calling for the arrests of all the officers involved after a Memorial Day viral video showed Floyd being pinned down by his neck by then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Floyd, who is repeatedly heard in the video saying he can't breath and asking for Chauvin to get off his neck, died that day.The Minneapolis mayor on Tuesday fired all four officers involved in the incident. On Friday, Chauvin was arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. But the other three officers who were involved in the incident have not yet been arrested or charged, with prosecutors in Minnesota on Friday saying that charges are likely forthcoming.D.C. and Manassas are among cities across the nation who held protests Friday night demanding the remaining three officers involved in Floyd's death to be arrested and charged.For more on the protests and riots learn more here: https://bit.ly/2ZQhNQR"

But with a great campaign to reduce the spread of infection, in the middle of May 2020, Thailand re-opened its restaurants and street food stalls for sit down, dining in customers - under certain regulations and guidelines. The main rule is that it’s one person per table, unless you have some kind of a barrier on the table. And street food vendors have become very creative to have cardboard or plastic shields to divide tables. Thai street food in 2020 - I wanted to go out and experience the social distance dining regulations in Bangkok for my self - so we my wife and I headed to Yaowarat, which is Bangkok’s Chinatown - known for its vibrant street food culture. Most street food stalls were open for evening service, but it was still very quiet compared to normal, maybe 15% of the action and energy and customers that would typically be there. Even though sit down customers are now permitted, many Thai street food stalls in Bangkok have taken to using apps for delivery. Here are the places and food we ate: Kuay Tiew Muay Zaa (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวหมวยซ่าาส์) - This is a noodle stall restaurant in the middle of Sampeng Market. I had never been here before, but just stopped in as it was a convenient location. I orderecd their Tom Yum Noodles (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวต้มยำ), which was pretty decently good, filled with a variety of fish balls. Ying had the yen ta fo (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวเย็นตาโฟ).Price - 40 THB (1.26 USD) per bowl Bitter Liquid (น้ำขม) Krua Porn La Mai (ครัวพรละมัย) - This is a legendary well known Thai street food stall in Chinatown, known for their flaming on iron skillets filled with a variety of different dishes. They set up tables with increased social distances, spacing out the tables, and with plastic sheet barriers between diners at each table. We ordered Suki (สุกี้น้ำไก่), Fried Noodles (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่กรอบ), and finally Oyster Omelet (หอยทอด).Total price - 230 THB (7.22 USD) Pa Tong Go Savoey (ปาท่องโก๋เสวย) - Finally, we ended this Thai street food tour in 2020 with Thai Chinese style pa tong go, or youtiou savory fried dough. It was delicious, this is one of the best places, featured in the Michelin Guide. Pa Tong Go (ปาท่องโก๋) - 70 THB. And that completes this Thai street food tour in 2020 in Bangkok, Thailand. Overall, most people wear masks, and many street food vendors have added plastic sheet shields to their cooking and food displays. Additionally, especially in busier areas of Bangkok, street food tables have a blockade between customers. Hope you’re doing well, having a great day, and keeping safe.

The arrival of Hurley and Behnken expanded the Expedition crew on board the orbital outpost.

They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks.”Trump has seized on protests against police brutality toward people of color to portray himself as an icon of law and order eschewing the soothing role past presidents have adopted in similar moments as he seeks to turn the election-year conversation from his widely criticized handling of the coronavirus outbreak.On the Monday call, Trump delivered his most strident message yet as cities across the country impose curfews and governors deploy the National Guard to try to head off another destructive evening. Many other peaceful protests also are underway mourning the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and demanding an end of police violence directed at African Americans and other minorities.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:Follow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktakeLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktakeFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktakeSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.comQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders."

Falcon 9 will lift off from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. A backup opportunity is available on Thursday, June 4 at 9:03 p.m. EDT, 1:03 UTC on June 5. Falcon 9’s first stage previously supported the Telstar 18 VANTAGE mission in September 2018, the Iridium-8 mission in January 2019, and two separate Starlink missions in May 2019 and in January 2020. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Just Read the Instructions” droneship, which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. The Starlink satellites will deploy in an elliptical orbit approximately 15 minutes after liftoff. Prior to orbit raise, SpaceX engineers will conduct data reviews to ensure all Starlink satellites are operating as intended. Once the checkouts are complete, the satellites will then use their onboard ion thrusters to move into their intended orbits and operational altitude of 550 km."

Andrew Cuomo blasted the city's response as a disgrace and accused the mayor and the NYPD of failing to do their jobs Tuesday night.I believe the mayor underestimates the scope of the problem. I think he underestimates the duration of the problem, Cuomo said Tuesday, adding he thought more cops should've been deployed on top of the already doubled patrol."

Discretion is advised. Protesters took to the streets on Monday in Washington, D.C. just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the nation on the ongoing protests rocking many U.S. states.  In his televised remarks, Trump said a 7 p.m. curfew would be “strictly enforced” within Washington D.C. as well, promising lengthy jail sentences and severe criminal penalties for anyone caught breaking the law.According to The Associated Press, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were now being sent to assist the U.S. capital, citing senior defence officials.Earlier on Monday, Trump had mocked the nation’s governors as “weak,” demanding that they enforce tougher crackdowns and more arrests in their states amid another night of violent protest in several American cities.The protests, which were sparked by the death of George Floyd — a Black man who died of suffocation after a video showed a white Minneapolis police officer with a knee on Floyd’s neck — have now entered their second week.MORE: http://globalnews.ca/news/7011316/trump-governors-george-floyd-protesters/For more info, please go to http://www.globalnews.caSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#GeorgeFloydProtests #GlobalNews #WashingtonDCProtestCurfew"

Justice for George Floyd protests sparked after video surfaced showing George Floyd’s killing by a Minneapolis police officer.Protests erupted nationwide days after Floyd’s death calling for the arrests of all the officers involved after a Memorial Day viral video showed Floyd being pinned down by his neck by then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Floyd, who is repeatedly heard in the video saying he can't breath and asking for Chauvin to get off his neck, died that day.The Minneapolis mayor on Tuesday fired all four officers involved in the incident. On Friday, Chauvin was arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. But the other three officers who were involved in the incident have not yet been arrested or charged, with prosecutors in Minnesota on Friday saying that charges are likely forthcoming.D.C. and Manassas are among cities across the nation who held protests Friday night demanding the remaining three officers involved in Floyd's death to be arrested and charged.For more on the protests and riots learn more here: https://bit.ly/2ZQhNQR"

But with a great campaign to reduce the spread of infection, in the middle of May 2020, Thailand re-opened its restaurants and street food stalls for sit down, dining in customers - under certain regulations and guidelines. The main rule is that it’s one person per table, unless you have some kind of a barrier on the table. And street food vendors have become very creative to have cardboard or plastic shields to divide tables. Thai street food in 2020 - I wanted to go out and experience the social distance dining regulations in Bangkok for my self - so we my wife and I headed to Yaowarat, which is Bangkok’s Chinatown - known for its vibrant street food culture. Most street food stalls were open for evening service, but it was still very quiet compared to normal, maybe 15% of the action and energy and customers that would typically be there. Even though sit down customers are now permitted, many Thai street food stalls in Bangkok have taken to using apps for delivery. Here are the places and food we ate: Kuay Tiew Muay Zaa (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวหมวยซ่าาส์) - This is a noodle stall restaurant in the middle of Sampeng Market. I had never been here before, but just stopped in as it was a convenient location. I orderecd their Tom Yum Noodles (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวต้มยำ), which was pretty decently good, filled with a variety of fish balls. Ying had the yen ta fo (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวเย็นตาโฟ).Price - 40 THB (1.26 USD) per bowl Bitter Liquid (น้ำขม) Krua Porn La Mai (ครัวพรละมัย) - This is a legendary well known Thai street food stall in Chinatown, known for their flaming on iron skillets filled with a variety of different dishes. They set up tables with increased social distances, spacing out the tables, and with plastic sheet barriers between diners at each table. We ordered Suki (สุกี้น้ำไก่), Fried Noodles (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่กรอบ), and finally Oyster Omelet (หอยทอด).Total price - 230 THB (7.22 USD) Pa Tong Go Savoey (ปาท่องโก๋เสวย) - Finally, we ended this Thai street food tour in 2020 with Thai Chinese style pa tong go, or youtiou savory fried dough. It was delicious, this is one of the best places, featured in the Michelin Guide. Pa Tong Go (ปาท่องโก๋) - 70 THB. And that completes this Thai street food tour in 2020 in Bangkok, Thailand. Overall, most people wear masks, and many street food vendors have added plastic sheet shields to their cooking and food displays. Additionally, especially in busier areas of Bangkok, street food tables have a blockade between customers. Hope you’re doing well, having a great day, and keeping safe.

The arrival of Hurley and Behnken expanded the Expedition crew on board the orbital outpost.

They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks.”Trump has seized on protests against police brutality toward people of color to portray himself as an icon of law and order eschewing the soothing role past presidents have adopted in similar moments as he seeks to turn the election-year conversation from his widely criticized handling of the coronavirus outbreak.On the Monday call, Trump delivered his most strident message yet as cities across the country impose curfews and governors deploy the National Guard to try to head off another destructive evening. Many other peaceful protests also are underway mourning the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and demanding an end of police violence directed at African Americans and other minorities.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:Follow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktakeLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktakeFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktakeSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.comQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders."

Falcon 9 will lift off from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. A backup opportunity is available on Thursday, June 4 at 9:03 p.m. EDT, 1:03 UTC on June 5. Falcon 9’s first stage previously supported the Telstar 18 VANTAGE mission in September 2018, the Iridium-8 mission in January 2019, and two separate Starlink missions in May 2019 and in January 2020. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Just Read the Instructions” droneship, which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. The Starlink satellites will deploy in an elliptical orbit approximately 15 minutes after liftoff. Prior to orbit raise, SpaceX engineers will conduct data reviews to ensure all Starlink satellites are operating as intended. Once the checkouts are complete, the satellites will then use their onboard ion thrusters to move into their intended orbits and operational altitude of 550 km."

Andrew Cuomo blasted the city's response as a disgrace and accused the mayor and the NYPD of failing to do their jobs Tuesday night.I believe the mayor underestimates the scope of the problem. I think he underestimates the duration of the problem, Cuomo said Tuesday, adding he thought more cops should've been deployed on top of the already doubled patrol."

Discretion is advised. Protesters took to the streets on Monday in Washington, D.C. just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the nation on the ongoing protests rocking many U.S. states.  In his televised remarks, Trump said a 7 p.m. curfew would be “strictly enforced” within Washington D.C. as well, promising lengthy jail sentences and severe criminal penalties for anyone caught breaking the law.According to The Associated Press, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were now being sent to assist the U.S. capital, citing senior defence officials.Earlier on Monday, Trump had mocked the nation’s governors as “weak,” demanding that they enforce tougher crackdowns and more arrests in their states amid another night of violent protest in several American cities.The protests, which were sparked by the death of George Floyd — a Black man who died of suffocation after a video showed a white Minneapolis police officer with a knee on Floyd’s neck — have now entered their second week.MORE: http://globalnews.ca/news/7011316/trump-governors-george-floyd-protesters/For more info, please go to http://www.globalnews.caSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#GeorgeFloydProtests #GlobalNews #WashingtonDCProtestCurfew"

Justice for George Floyd protests sparked after video surfaced showing George Floyd’s killing by a Minneapolis police officer.Protests erupted nationwide days after Floyd’s death calling for the arrests of all the officers involved after a Memorial Day viral video showed Floyd being pinned down by his neck by then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Floyd, who is repeatedly heard in the video saying he can't breath and asking for Chauvin to get off his neck, died that day.The Minneapolis mayor on Tuesday fired all four officers involved in the incident. On Friday, Chauvin was arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. But the other three officers who were involved in the incident have not yet been arrested or charged, with prosecutors in Minnesota on Friday saying that charges are likely forthcoming.D.C. and Manassas are among cities across the nation who held protests Friday night demanding the remaining three officers involved in Floyd's death to be arrested and charged.For more on the protests and riots learn more here: https://bit.ly/2ZQhNQR"

But with a great campaign to reduce the spread of infection, in the middle of May 2020, Thailand re-opened its restaurants and street food stalls for sit down, dining in customers - under certain regulations and guidelines. The main rule is that it’s one person per table, unless you have some kind of a barrier on the table. And street food vendors have become very creative to have cardboard or plastic shields to divide tables. Thai street food in 2020 - I wanted to go out and experience the social distance dining regulations in Bangkok for my self - so we my wife and I headed to Yaowarat, which is Bangkok’s Chinatown - known for its vibrant street food culture. Most street food stalls were open for evening service, but it was still very quiet compared to normal, maybe 15% of the action and energy and customers that would typically be there. Even though sit down customers are now permitted, many Thai street food stalls in Bangkok have taken to using apps for delivery. Here are the places and food we ate: Kuay Tiew Muay Zaa (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวหมวยซ่าาส์) - This is a noodle stall restaurant in the middle of Sampeng Market. I had never been here before, but just stopped in as it was a convenient location. I orderecd their Tom Yum Noodles (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวต้มยำ), which was pretty decently good, filled with a variety of fish balls. Ying had the yen ta fo (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวเย็นตาโฟ).Price - 40 THB (1.26 USD) per bowl Bitter Liquid (น้ำขม) Krua Porn La Mai (ครัวพรละมัย) - This is a legendary well known Thai street food stall in Chinatown, known for their flaming on iron skillets filled with a variety of different dishes. They set up tables with increased social distances, spacing out the tables, and with plastic sheet barriers between diners at each table. We ordered Suki (สุกี้น้ำไก่), Fried Noodles (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่กรอบ), and finally Oyster Omelet (หอยทอด).Total price - 230 THB (7.22 USD) Pa Tong Go Savoey (ปาท่องโก๋เสวย) - Finally, we ended this Thai street food tour in 2020 with Thai Chinese style pa tong go, or youtiou savory fried dough. It was delicious, this is one of the best places, featured in the Michelin Guide. Pa Tong Go (ปาท่องโก๋) - 70 THB. And that completes this Thai street food tour in 2020 in Bangkok, Thailand. Overall, most people wear masks, and many street food vendors have added plastic sheet shields to their cooking and food displays. Additionally, especially in busier areas of Bangkok, street food tables have a blockade between customers. Hope you’re doing well, having a great day, and keeping safe.

The arrival of Hurley and Behnken expanded the Expedition crew on board the orbital outpost.

They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks.”Trump has seized on protests against police brutality toward people of color to portray himself as an icon of law and order eschewing the soothing role past presidents have adopted in similar moments as he seeks to turn the election-year conversation from his widely criticized handling of the coronavirus outbreak.On the Monday call, Trump delivered his most strident message yet as cities across the country impose curfews and governors deploy the National Guard to try to head off another destructive evening. Many other peaceful protests also are underway mourning the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and demanding an end of police violence directed at African Americans and other minorities.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:Follow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktakeLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktakeFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktakeSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.comQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders."
