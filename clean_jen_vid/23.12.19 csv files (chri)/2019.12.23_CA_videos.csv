In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn’t do much about it.Unless… we move our whole solar system out of the way.Support us on Patreon so we can make more videos (and get cool stuff in return): https://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt?ty=hSteady: https://steadyhq.com/de/kurzgesagtMerchandise:  https://shop.kurzgesagt.org Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/cRUQxzFacebook: http://bit.ly/1NB6U5OTwitter: http://bit.ly/2DDeT83Instagram: http://bit.ly/2DEN7r3Discord: https://discord.gg/cB7ycdvThe Voice of Kurzgesagt: Steve Taylor: http://voice-pool.com/en/english/The music of the video here: Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/34L3USGBandcamp: https://bit.ly/38YgiC5Youtube: https://bit.ly/2CZ6PeNFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4 THANKS A LOT TO OUR LOVELY PATRONS FOR SUPPORTING US:Patrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, Имяя Фамилияя, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, Máté Szabó, Kasper Kylmälä, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet"

Set aside.Set up a double boiler over medium heat. Add the eggs and sugar to the top bowl, whisking vigorously until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture has thickened slightly, about 5 minutes.Add the water and evaporated milk to the egg mixture and stir to combine.Slowly add the dry ingredients to egg mixture and mix until well combined.Stir in the vanilla and vegetable oil.Pour the batter through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean bowl to catch any lumps.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the batter rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or overnight.Transfer the batter to a spouted liquid measuring cup for easy pouring.Set an egg waffle machine and set to 400°F (200°C). Grease lightly with oil. Add about 1 cup of batter to the machine and cook for 2½ minutes, until crispy and slightly brown. Using a rubber spatula, transfer the waffle to a wire rack to cool slightly. To achieve a round shape, lay the waffle over a curved surface, such as a rolling pin, to cool. Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve when the shell has cooled and become crisp but still warm, and enjoy!RECIPE BY: Jacqueline TrisShop the NEW Tasty Merch: https://bzfd.it/shoptastyyoutubeSubscribe to Tasty: https://bzfd.it/2ri82Z1About Tasty:The official YouTube channel of all things Tasty, the world's largest food network.

The natural beauty, the friendliness of the people, and the amazingly flavorful food, is what makes Kerala so special. Thanks to Ebbin from Food N Travel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-wTAWLHOWLYyZI9m_JV8zg) who took us on an ultimate food tour of Kerala. Can’t wait to share all of the videos with you.Kannur - We started in the North of Kerala, the Malabar Coast on the Arabian Sea. Kannur, is a friendly town, laid back, and there’s plenty of amazing street food to try.Onakkan Bharathi (Puttu Restaurant, Kannur) - We started this Indian street food tour with puttu, mutton curry, and a variety of lentils and chickpeas for breakfast. The combination was fantastic, perfect harmony of spice and flavor. The heat mostly came from black pepper. Total price - 286 INR ($4.03)Kerala crunchy snacks - Thanks to Roshan from Seashell Haris Beach Home in Kannur, for taking us to eat local snacks all drenched in chutney. I wasn’t all that excited at first for snacks in glass jugs - but the chutney blew me away. Unbelievable flavors coming out of that chutney and pickled snacks. 10 INR ($0.14) - Price per bowlStreet Mussels - Next up on this Kerala street food tour, we went to an afternoon snack stall specializing in mainly hot masala mussels, which were formed into dumpling like shapes, and fried in hot coconut oil. They were superb, as were everything else. 200 INR ($2.81) - Price for everythingChili Soda - Finally to end this food tour of Kannur, we had a soothing chili and coriander soda - they put pickled chillies and coriander in pineapple juice in a soda. It’s amazing.Friends in the video:Ebbin: https://www.instagram.com/foodntraveltv/Roshan: https://www.instagram.com/seashellharisbeachhome/Joel: https://www.instagram.com/kru_joel/🎵MUSIC: https://www.audionetwork.com/——————————————————🍌Banana Chips are available now worldwide!!https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens👕Get t-shirts and caps:https://migrationology.com/store/📷Camera gear I use:https://kit.co/markwiens/camera-video-gear——————————————————📱FOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

In this video, I’m going to show you 5 red flags that can help you determine that this may be the case before it’s too hard to do something about it. Each of these early warning signs will serve to get you to take notice and quickly change up your training so that you can start making nothing but gains.We all know that gaining muscle is something that will take us an extended period of time, especially once we are past the newbie gains stage of our training. That said, when it seems like an eternity without seeing any appreciable progress it can become pretty frustrating and sometimes even to the point where we want to give up.That would be a mistake.You can do something to get back on the right track and to seeing muscle building goals being reached very quickly. The first red flag to be on the lookout for is the lack of a pump from your workouts. Once believed to be only a side effect to please your ego, the pump is now recognized as something much more important. Through intracellular tension stress on the muscle cell, the pump is capable of driving a stimulus for muscle growth that was once overlooked. Beyond this, the lack of one can be a hint that you may be too one dimensional in your training focus. Time to switch it up or at least, mix it up.Second, you need to get sore in your training. Well, not that kind of soreness. What I mean is that when you attempt to contract a given muscle as hard as possible you should be able to feel a discomfort within the muscle belly indicative of a strong mind muscle connection. If you are not, then even your bigger compound lifts are struggling since they represent the sum effort of all the individual muscles to the task at hand.Third, you can learn a lot from the color of your urine. If you are peeing too yellow then you are likely not taking in enough water and are in some state of dehydration. This is a major problem. Just as it is impossible to grow a flower without water, growing a muscle in a dehydrated environment is not a good idea. Beyond the clarity however is the frequency. At a minimum, you need to be going to the bathroom at least 10 or 12 times a day. If you are going less than this then you need to up your water intake as soon as possible if you want to see muscle growth and gains.The fourth red flag has to do with your recovery from your training. If you are not recovering between workouts then you are likely not having an anabolic effect from the next workout you are about to do. That is a problem. You can stave this off and foretell when this is about to become especially problematic by taking out the old school bathroom scale and squeezing it with two hands as I show you. Take the reading and look for a ten percent drop-off from morning to morning. This would indicate that the central nervous system is not as recovered as it should be, which is often the first to fatigue before the muscles stop responding.Finally, take a note of your performance in your workouts from set to set. If you are seeing more than a 10-15% drop-off in the amount of weight you can handle from one set to the next (especially early on in your workout) or a greater than 30% drop in the number of reps that you can perform when resting 90 seconds between sets, then you are likely not recovered and will start to see muscle gains come to a halt. Increase the amount of time you rest between sets to see if that corrects the issue. If it does not, take a hard look at your training and be willing to make changes to get yourself back on track.So to recap for those that prefer lists:1. Lack of Pump2. Lack of Contraction Soreness3. Not Peeing Clear at Least 10 Times a Day4. Grip Strength decreasing - CNS burnout5. Intraset Recovery - 10-15% Drop Off in Strength Between SetsIf you are looking for a training program that will help you to get nothing but gains, without overtraining, be sure to head to athleanx.com at the link below and get the program that matches your exact goals.

Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!PICKLE PRE-ORDER: https://creators.teespring.com/moriah-elizabeth-pickle-plushie/_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). CURRENT SERIES:Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewersThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard salesBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real lifeCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)Squishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewersCraft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____CREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCHhttps://me-merch.myshopify.comMORE MERCH:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/____ME SOCIALS____INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/VISIT ME WEBSITE:https://www.moriahelizabeth.com/____CONTACT ME____EMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_____MAIL ME_____For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address (mail accepted from those ages 13+ ONLY)ATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.

Does more expensive mean more better? And is it worth it?Donut bought two identical 350z’s and we have been modifying them to be fun, daily drivers that you can take to the track.James Pumphrey and Zach Jobe are on Team Hi, and their Z gets the expensive parts. Nolan Sykes and Aaron Parker are on Team Low, and their 350z gets the cheap parts. Afterwards, the teams test them to see which components are actually worth spending the money on. So far, we’ve installed coilovers and new wheel and tire combos on the 350Zs, and now we’re moving on to brakes. The ability to stop well is probably one of the more underrated features of a car. But if you’re planning some serious go-fast mods, like the turbo kits coming soon, or you want to turn yourself into a track rat, braking should be a priority. It’s just plain safer. And if you’re looking for the fastest possible laps, being able to brake harder and later means you’ll be shaving off time. So we want to see what kind of results we can get from a really basic brake upgrade versus a full super expensive brake kit. This time, Nolan and Aaron are getting a lot less total stuff for their money. Their $450 basic brake upgrade kit just comes with drilled and slotted rotors, braided stainless steel brake lines, Centric Posi Quiet brake pads for the street, and some Motul brake fluid. Low Car is keeping its stock sliding calipers, which aren’t quite as confidence-inspiring as opposed-piston calipers. Their design makes them flex more, so the pedal might not feel as good as James’ will after his brake upgrade. Hi Team is getting a full-on, 4-wheel upgrade with Wilwood 6-piston front calipers and 2-piston rear calipers, bigger 13-inch front rotors, pads, and braided stainless lines to the tune of $4400.Is more expensive more better?

It's delicious. Especially when you learn to make this simple recipe yourself. Or when you manipulate a friend to make beef chili for you. Also, beans. Who knew some people feel so strongly about beans in beef chili. I did. I feel strongly that I like chili with or without beans. The Book of Babish https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/cookbookYSAC Book and shop: http://yousuckatcooking.comSubscribe: http://bit.ly/1HuynlYhttp://instagram.com/yousuckatcookinghttps://twitter.com/yousuckatcookinAlright to make this chili do something like this: Brown around two pounds of beef by putting your skillet on medium high with a teaspoon of oil which you may not need if you beef is more fatty. Break it up in the pan then let it sit until a crust starts to form, then flip and do the same thing again Dice a large onion and chop it up Do the same with three cloves of garlicHeat your chili pot on medium with some olive oil then sauté the onion until it starts to brownThrow the garlic in during the last couple of minutesThen add the beef with a teaspoon of salt and break it up moreAdd in 28oz/790g crushed tomatoes2 tablespoon chili powder1 tablespoon cumin 1 to 1.5 cups beef broth…adjust as necessary ½ tablespoon of brown sugar15.5oz/439g chatty bastard kidney beansThen add hot sauce or more spice as desired. Then add toppings, which don’t count as chili ingredients, because they are on top, not inside. They’re not really a part of the chili. The chili is it’s own thing. It’s like calling ketchup a hot dog. Ketchup isn’t a hot dog. It’s ketchup. It has it’s own life. Don’t argue with me here. It will get you nowhere and it will just waste both of our times. Especially if you’re right."

Why, for example, are the fundamental constants - like the mass of the electron or the strength of the forces - just right for the emergence of life? Tweak them too much and life, stars, galaxies, the universe as we know it wouldn’t exist. In recent episodes we explored one possible explanation for this - the anthropic principle and the idea of the multiverse. If there are countless universes with different fundamental constants, then it’s not surprising that a few exist with the right numbers for life - and certainly not surprising that we find ourselves in one of those good ones. But if you don’t like the anthropic principle - and many scientists don’t - then rest assured, there’s an alternative. You only need to accept two things: that our universe formed inside a black hole, and that universes can evolve.Hosted by Matt O'DowdWritten by Matt O'DowdGraphics by Leonardo Scholzer & Adriano LealDirected by: Andrew KornhaberExecutive Producers: Eric Brown & Andrew KornhaberSpecial Thanks to our Patreon Sponsors: Big BangAndrew & BrennaAlexander TamasCraig StonahaDavid BarnholdtDavid NicklasFabrice EapJohn SJuan BenetMorgan HoughQuasarMark HeisingVinnie FalcoHypernovaChuck ZegarDanton SpiveyDonal BotkinEdmund FokschanerHank SJohn HofmannJohn PollockJohn R.

One day, Beck received a message from her friend about someone she should add on social media. Beck didn't know the person, but her friend told her that if she connected with him, he would give her free money online. Beck decided to go for it - the idea of free money got her really excited. When she added the man, he started messaging her and offering her money right away. He promised to treat her right, but then he started asking her weird questions. He asked her for her shoe size, height, age - lots of personal details about Beck. Beck responded, but she gave him fake information. Then, the man asked Beck for inappropriate pictures she wasn't comfortable with. When she denied his request, he responded by saying that he would still give her the money if she sent his profile to 5 of her friends that were girls - they HAD to be girls. The promise of free money was too hard for her to pass up, so she sent his information to some friends. Some of her friends thought it was sketchy and didn't add him, but some of them did. When it was time for Beck to get the money he promised her, he asked her for her address. Then, at that moment, Beck made a big mistake - she sent him her REAL address. Beck's friends freaked out and started telling him that her address was fake, which made him extremely angry. He started sending Beck scary, threatening messages. At that point, Beck realized she made a huge mistake. Beck decided to show her school officer the messages and screen shots, and Beck's school decided to call the police. Beck was even more upset when the police told her that the man she was talking to was likely a criminal, and the whole situation was really scary for her. She regretted giving out any personal information, and the entire experience taught her what it means to stay safe online.When she looks back now, she can say to herself, A stranger offered me money on social media - and it taught me an important lesson.Record your story @ https://storybooth.com or our iPhone app for a chance to get animated.______What's your true story?  storybooth wants to hear it!
