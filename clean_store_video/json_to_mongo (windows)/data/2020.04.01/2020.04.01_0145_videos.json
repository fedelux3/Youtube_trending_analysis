      "description": "The deadly coronavirus pandemic has stopped the world in its tracks, and exposed a weak spot in the United States\u2019 preparedness for a public health emergency. Experts say aggressive diagnostic testing is essential in order to learn where and how an epidemic spreads. But in the critical first weeks of the outbreak in the U.S., one problem after another prevented doctors, clinics, and labs around the country from testing enough people. Patients in America were being sent home as hospitals rationed their test supply, while other countries like South Korea found a way to test hundreds of thousands of people quickly. Now, the U.S. is months behind in understanding the true scope of the virus. Testing capacity is finally ramping up, but is it too late?\n\nProduced by: Arielle Berger and Jordan Smith\nWritten by: Arielle Berger\nSenior Producer: Jeff Morganteen\nGraphics by: Jason Reginato\nAdditional Footage: Getty Images\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\r\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\r\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\r\n\r\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

La canzone \u00e8 il desiderio di rinascita e di speranza, una dedica a chi ci ha lasciato e ai loro familiari, un ringraziamento per tutti coloro che lavorano incessantemente al bene degli altri: medici, infermieri e tutto il personale ospedaliero, sono gli eroi e le eroine di questi nostri giorni.

      "description": "Doing home workouts can seem like a bad idea to those who fear losing all of their muscle gains by training away from the gym. In this video, I\u2019m going to show you that this is not something to be fearful of as long as you avoid these 10 most common home workout mistakes. In fact, it is possible to build muscle at home with little to no equipment if you get all of these right. So that said, let\u2019s dive in and start making sure you are.\n\nFirst, you must not focus so much on the equipment that you don\u2019t have and instead look around at the opportunities you do have. I covered in a recent home workout video how you have countertops, stairs, doorways, hardwood floors and even tables that you can use to get a complete total body workout with nothing but your own bodyweight. Watch that if you feel like you are out of ideas for what to do now that your gym is closed.\n\nNext, in a rush to overcompensate for the lack of a gym people will attempt to do home workouts and exercises that are simply too difficult for them. What happens here is that they either get hurt or just become discouraged when the results aren\u2019t satisfactory. This is because they would have gotten much more out of doing the exercises that were appropriate for them and that they had done with proper form and intensity.\n\nThird, exercise variety is key when it comes to training at home. This is not because you are trying to create muscle confusion or \u201cshock the muscles\u201d. Instead, this is because the variety of home exercises is what provides the easiest path for overload. Slight changes to the same exercise can provide a totally unique stimulus to the muscles you are trying to train and lead to new muscle gains.\n\nSpeaking of overload, the fourth mistake relates to how many will program for it in the form of specific rep counts with home and bodyweight workouts. This is a mistake. One size does not fit all when it comes to calisthenics. Instead, train to failure or just shy to ensure that you are neither underserving or over serving your abilities in your workouts.\n\nThe fifth biggest home workout mistake is relying too much on cardio or hiit movements instead of strength building exercises. Look, I love burpees, mountain climbers and jumping jacks but they are not going to build muscle. Doing too many of them in your home workout routines will cause you to lose muscle instead of build it. You need to focus the majority of your efforts on exercises that build muscle like pullups, handstand pushups and more.\n\nThe sixth biggest mistake is forgetting to train your back at home. Not only will this lead to an underwhelming physique but it will create muscle imbalances that lead directly to the seventh mistake and that is bad posture.\n\nFinally, the last three relate to the implementation of your workout routine into a new routine. If you don\u2019t plan to get your workout in at home it is too easy to find yourself being too random and skipping your workout all together. Schedule it into your day and FaceTime a friend if needed to hold yourself accountable. Don\u2019t do it in your living room either if you can avoid it. Too tempting to hit the couch during a rest period and never get off of it.\n\nTo build muscle at home you have to be willing to avoid the biggest workout mistakes. These are just a few of the things that people tend to do at home when they are doing total body workouts that hinder the muscle gains that they see. If you want to build muscle at home and do it without equipment you have to use a workout that doesn't make mistakes like these.\n\nIf you are looking for a complete home workout program that doesn\u2019t require any equipment at all, be sure to head to athleanx.com and check out the ATHLEAN XERO program. Build solid muscle at home without any equipment in just 6 weeks and see how powerful the right bodyweight training can be. \n\nFor more videos on how to build muscle at home and the best home workouts you can do to build bigger muscles, be sure to subscribe to our channel here via the link below and turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it\u2019s published.\n\nBuild Muscle with No Equipment - http://athleanx.com/xero\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://youtube.com/user/jdcav24"

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right\u2014within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he\u2019s only only getting better with time."

To see how we're passing the time, check out my instagram stories https://www.instagram.com/sethsbikehacks\n\nThe whale tail has been in the works for a while, but I haven't had the chance to build it until now. A lot of things needed to be in place, like the landing, a better roll-in, that kicker, not to mention a working Kevin Jump with a wood berm after it. Thanks to Kevin, Brian, and Alexander for helping out on this build.
