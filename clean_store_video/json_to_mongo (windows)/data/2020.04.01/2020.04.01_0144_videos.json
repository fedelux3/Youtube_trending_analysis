Shop our chai here: https://www.chaiwalachai.com\n\nFriends featured in today\u2019s van life vlog:\nLee https://www.instagram.com/leemacmil/\n\nAfter an incredible 3 years of living, working and travelling in our self converted Sprinter Van we\u2019ve had to make the very tough decision to abandon our tiny home in Africa to take a rescue flight back to Canada.  As it has for so, so many of us, this global pandemic has absolutely flipped our world upside down. What went from a virus that seemed far away in China, quickly made it\u2019s way across the globe forcing us to quarantine in our 60 sq-ft in Morocco. And while quarantining was going well for us it became apparent that things would be different for a long while.  When our Prime Minister announced that he was sending repatriation flights over to Africa to pick up Canadians who were stuck (due to border closures) we consulted with friends and family closest to us and realized that in this time of crisis we should be back in our home country. The gravity of what we\u2019ve just done hasn\u2019t quite sunk in and we ((especially me (Bec)) are having a really hard time adjusting to our new reality.  Having said that we think the most important thing we can all do now is STAY HOME, keep healthy with healing foods & try to look at this as a time that we (and the planet) desperately needed to reset and realign.  Sending each of you so much love throughout this time x\n\n\u2733 Eamon & Bec Products \u2733\n\u21a0 our handmade chai blends https://chaiwalachai.com/ \u219e\n\u21a0 our plant-based cookbook https://www.eamonandbec.com/weekday-whip-ups \u219e\n\u21a0 our beautiful photo filters https://www.eamonandbec.com/presets \u219e\n\nTour the renovations we've done to our self converted sprinter van:\nVAN TOUR after 2 years living in our TINY HOUSE on wheels http://bit.ly/newvantour\n\nOVERLANDING AFRICA IN OUR SPRINTER VAN has been the adventure we\u2019ve always hoped it would be but it\u2019s hard to predict what happens next. In fact, we are still processing everything that has happened over the last week and continues to happen... No one knows where we will end up, where our beloved tiny home on wheels will make it or for how long this pandemic will take over life as we know but all we can do is try to remain positive and move forward in the direction that feels right for us. We hope you are all keeping safe during this time \u2764\ufe0f.\n\nWant updates in between videos? \n\u25baInstagram https://instagram.com/eamonandbec\n\nWhat's in Our Camera Bag? \nFor a blog post on our camera gear click here: https://www.eamonandbec.com/blog\nSecret Weapon to our Steady Shots https://amzn.to/3c327xq\nThe Lens that Does it All https://amzn.to/2Tb88zq\nMain Camera https://amzn.to/38X6fNw\nHow We Shoot a Timelapse https://amzn.to/2VgAOcQ\nOur Flying Camera https://amzn.to/38U5TqB\nStarting a Vlog?
