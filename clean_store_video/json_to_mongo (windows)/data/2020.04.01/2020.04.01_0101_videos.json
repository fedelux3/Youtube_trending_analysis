To see how we're passing the time, check out my instagram stories https://www.instagram.com/sethsbikehacks\n\nThe whale tail has been in the works for a while, but I haven't had the chance to build it until now. A lot of things needed to be in place, like the landing, a better roll-in, that kicker, not to mention a working Kevin Jump with a wood berm after it.

      "description": "The deadly coronavirus pandemic has stopped the world in its tracks, and exposed a weak spot in the United States\u2019 preparedness for a public health emergency. Experts say aggressive diagnostic testing is essential in order to learn where and how an epidemic spreads. But in the critical first weeks of the outbreak in the U.S., one problem after another prevented doctors, clinics, and labs around the country from testing enough people. Patients in America were being sent home as hospitals rationed their test supply, while other countries like South Korea found a way to test hundreds of thousands of people quickly. Now, the U.S. is months behind in understanding the true scope of the virus. Testing capacity is finally ramping up, but is it too late?\n\nProduced by: Arielle Berger and Jordan Smith\nWritten by: Arielle Berger\nSenior Producer: Jeff Morganteen\nGraphics by: Jason Reginato\nAdditional Footage: Getty Images\n\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\r\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\r\n\u00bb Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\r\n\r\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.
