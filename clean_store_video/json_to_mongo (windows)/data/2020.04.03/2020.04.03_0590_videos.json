La canzone \u00e8 il desiderio di rinascita e di speranza, una dedica a chi ci ha lasciato e ai loro familiari, un ringraziamento per tutti coloro che lavorano incessantemente al bene degli altri: medici, infermieri e tutto il personale ospedaliero, sono gli eroi e le eroine di questi nostri giorni.

The Rockstar Energy Drink / Nexen Tire Toyota Corolla Hatchback is the latest competition build from the Hawthorne, California, based team. \n\nTeam owner Stephan Papadakis is a legend of sport\u00ad compact racing who began building his reputation in the 1990s with the first front-wheel \u00addrive, tube\u00ad-chassis drag car in the U.S. The team earned multiple records and championships in the discipline, turning in elapsed times and trap speeds previously thought unattainable in front\u00ad-drive drag cars. Papadakis' successes in front\u00ad-wheel drive were matched by his efforts in rear\u00ad-wheel drive when he campaigned a Honda Civic that became just the fifth car to join the NHRA's Sport Compact 200 MPH club"

      "description": "Ontario Premier Doug Ford held a briefing on COVID-19 on Tuesday and announced that publicly-funded schools would remain closed until at least May 1 for teachers and May 4 for students. Private schools and child care centre closures have also been extended for two weeks, with Education Minister Stephen Lecce explaining the shorter closure for these institutions is because they fall under the province's emergency order, extended to mid-April, as opposed to the Education Act.\n\nLecce also laid out the next stage of learning for students at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, which would reconnect students with teachers, and give access to online tools and report cards for students and educators. He said they also are working to provide more assistance for students with special needs as well as more mental health support.\n\nOntario Colleges and Universities Minister Ross Romano said on Tuesday that in addition to a six-month deferral for student loans through OSAP, the government would also be providing universities, colleges and Indigenous institutes with $25 million to use how they see fit as they deal with the difficulties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said students would be able to complete examinations online and be graded so they can further their education.\n\nWhen asked about reports some landlords are allegedly using threats to get tenants to pay rent during the COVID-19 outbreak, Ford said that people should not consider the pandemic a \"blank cheque\" to not pay rent. He advised people still employed and able to must still pay rent, but said those who are unemployed or struggling should try to work with landlords to find a solution, adding that they had previously advised no eviction orders can be issued during this time.\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/6755700/coronavirus-ford-government-e-learning-covid-19/\n\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews #onpoli #COVID19 #Coronavirus"

      "description": "This was the last video we filmed before the worldwide isolations began, and we recognise some ingredients may be harder to come by in these times. The amazing thing with curries is they are ultra versatile: \n\n- Don\u2019t have a veggie? Simply substitute it with one you have in the fridge. \n- Don\u2019t have fresh spinach? Try frozen spinach, or just leave it out. \n- Substitute the beans for lentils, or vice versa. \n- If you don\u2019t have one of the spices, simply omit it, or substitute it for curry powder. The other spices will still come together to make the dish super flavourful. \n- Don't have the garnishes? You definitely don't need them - the curries are flavourful enough on their own! \n\nIt\u2019s hard to go wrong with any of these recipes, and who knows? Maybe your variation will be even better than the original!
