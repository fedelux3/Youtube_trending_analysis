But Roscoe is really his sister Rachel posing as her own dead brother, who\u2019s been killed by her boyfriend Stanley Stubbers.\n\nHoled up at The Cricketers\u2019 Arms, the permanently ravenous Francis spots the chance of an extra meal ticket and takes a second job with one Stanley Stubbers, who is hiding from the police and waiting to be re-united with Rachel. To prevent discovery, Francis must keep his two guvnors apart.

      "description": "This is a secret car collection I've been trying to visit for the past 3 years with no luck. However recently, I was asked to detail a couple very rare cars, Ferrari, Corvette, Camaro, and a Lamborghini to name a few...for an upcoming auction. The first was a Bizzarrini P538 which is valued at nearly $1,000,000 and is by the far the most expensive barn find I have had the privilege of detailing. This is the first wash and paint polishing this vehicle has received in over 32 years. It was parked next to a Noble with a Ferrari engine which was also in need of an extreme detailing. I wanted to call this a disgusting car make over or a disaster detailing junk yard find, but the Bizzarrini is just too awesome to give it such a title.

      "description": "The dirt jump trail building series has been awesome. I've always loved building and digging trails but to do it in my backyard is the dream. The ground is finally hardening up ready for riding but with less and less dirt, we've had to turn towards wooden features to make progress! So in this lockdown episode I decided to fulfil a lot your requests and build an MTB whale tail, which is a slopestyle feature from competitions like Crankworx! Unfortunately we don't have unlimited supplies of wood or timber so had to get resourceful again to make it happen. It was sick to do some riding and shout out to Ben for hitting it on his BMX. In the next video we'll be riding the trails, so stay tuned for some backyard dirt jump action!
