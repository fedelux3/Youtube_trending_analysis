Visit http://www.audible.com/womanly or text womanly to 500-500\n\nWatch Next: HOW TO DRESS BETTER *life changing* https://youtu.be/ljf4l6Nuh8Q\n\nColor theory is easily the NUMBER ONE THING I wish I'd known about when I was younger!  So many of the times I thought my skin or whole self didn't look good it was because the color and shade I was wearing was working against me.  Color is simple to the eye, but a little complex to understand.  I have simplified it, through my eyes in this video so you can shop and use this as a guide for purchases that bring you tons of confidence.  Enjoy the video!\n\nJoin Me On Social:\nInstagram: @AlexandrasGirlyTalk http://bit.ly/1TSclUm\nFacebook: Alexandra Beth https://goo.gl/dtTo71\n\nHi, I'm Alexandra.  I believe life can be both glorious, tricky and painful.. which we all know.  Beauty is a practice I have enjoyed from early childhood as a way to build my confidence in myself.  Not just on \"special\" occasions, but in my every day life and decision making. On my YouTube channel I show you practical steps and psychology to understand and apply methods in all areas of beauty; inclding fashion, makeup, hairstyling and femininity, to help us evolve and transform into our personal visions. I believe when a girl feels good about herself, she can make better choices for herself in ALL areas of life.  Welcome to my channel, I'm glad you found me!\n\nBusiness Inquiries: abeth.pa@gmail.com\n\nFTC: this video is sponsored by Audible"

Plus they\u2019re making a 4FT Snickers bar, massive Butterfinger, and other epic real chocolate vs sour gummy food like you\u2019ve never seen before. Last time there was a crazy competition to make funny prank fake foods like McDonald\u2019s burgers, Pizza Hut Pizza, and Coca Cola from tasty candies like Skittles, Hershey\u2019s syrup, Oreo cookies, and Amazon waffle irons. Today brothers (not twins) the key bros compete to make giant edible donuts, Wonka Nerds Ropes, and Kinder Eggs 1000x their normal size. And try not to laugh at the end as Collins and Devan bite, taste, and try their creations. Trying and testing these foods are so much fun! It\u2019s another awesome and amazing viral video in this satisfying comedy entertainment and easy tutorial life hacks and pranks compilation series.\u00a0\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry, we didn\u2019t eat all of this ourselves.

The Rockstar Energy Drink / Nexen Tire Toyota Corolla Hatchback is the latest competition build from the Hawthorne, California, based team. \n\nTeam owner Stephan Papadakis is a legend of sport\u00ad compact racing who began building his reputation in the 1990s with the first front-wheel \u00addrive, tube\u00ad-chassis drag car in the U.S. The team earned multiple records and championships in the discipline, turning in elapsed times and trap speeds previously thought unattainable in front\u00ad-drive drag cars. Papadakis' successes in front\u00ad-wheel drive were matched by his efforts in rear\u00ad-wheel drive when he campaigned a Honda Civic that became just the fifth car to join the NHRA's Sport Compact 200 MPH club"
