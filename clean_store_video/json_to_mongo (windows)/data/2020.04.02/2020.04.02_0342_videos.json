It was led by Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick, who was joined - 2m apart, of course - by deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries. \n\n\n\nIt could be at least six months before life in the UK returns to \"normal\", England's deputy chief medical officer has said.\n\nSpeaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Dr Jenny Harries added: \"This is not to say we would be in complete lockdown for six months.\"\n\nBut, she added, \"We have to be really, really responsible and keep doing what we're all doing.\"\n\nDr Harries said the government would review the lockdown measures for the first time in three weeks.\n\nBut she warned the public: \"We must not then suddenly revert to our normal way of living. That would be quite dangerous.\"\n\nShe continued: \"If we stop then all of our efforts will be wasted and we could potentially see a second peak.\n\n\"So over time, probably over the next six months, we will have a three-week review. We will see where we are going.\n\n\"We need to keep that lid on - and then gradually we will be able to hopefully adjust some of the social distancing measures and gradually get us all back to normal.\n\n\"Three weeks for review, two or three months to see whether we have really squashed it but about three to six months ideally, and lots of uncertainty in that, but then to see at which point we can actually get back to normal.\"\n\nBut Dr Harries also said it was \"plausible\" that it could further than that.\n\nOn the number of deaths from the virus, she added: \"We actually anticipate our numbers will get worse over the next week, possibly two, and then we are looking to see whether we have managed to push that curve down and we start to see a decline.\"\n\n\n\nBBC News Special | Coronavirus Daily Update UK PM | BBC\n\n#BBC #BBCiPlayer #BBCNews #BBCCoronavirus #Coronavirus #Covid19 #CoronavirusOutbreak #Corona #CoronavirusUK\n\nAll our TV channels and S4C are available to watch live through BBC iPlayer, although some programmes may not be available to stream online due to rights.

      "description": "Doing home workouts can seem like a bad idea to those who fear losing all of their muscle gains by training away from the gym. In this video, I\u2019m going to show you that this is not something to be fearful of as long as you avoid these 10 most common home workout mistakes. In fact, it is possible to build muscle at home with little to no equipment if you get all of these right. So that said, let\u2019s dive in and start making sure you are.\n\nFirst, you must not focus so much on the equipment that you don\u2019t have and instead look around at the opportunities you do have. I covered in a recent home workout video how you have countertops, stairs, doorways, hardwood floors and even tables that you can use to get a complete total body workout with nothing but your own bodyweight. Watch that if you feel like you are out of ideas for what to do now that your gym is closed.\n\nNext, in a rush to overcompensate for the lack of a gym people will attempt to do home workouts and exercises that are simply too difficult for them. What happens here is that they either get hurt or just become discouraged when the results aren\u2019t satisfactory. This is because they would have gotten much more out of doing the exercises that were appropriate for them and that they had done with proper form and intensity.\n\nThird, exercise variety is key when it comes to training at home. This is not because you are trying to create muscle confusion or \u201cshock the muscles\u201d. Instead, this is because the variety of home exercises is what provides the easiest path for overload. Slight changes to the same exercise can provide a totally unique stimulus to the muscles you are trying to train and lead to new muscle gains.\n\nSpeaking of overload, the fourth mistake relates to how many will program for it in the form of specific rep counts with home and bodyweight workouts. This is a mistake. One size does not fit all when it comes to calisthenics. Instead, train to failure or just shy to ensure that you are neither underserving or over serving your abilities in your workouts.\n\nThe fifth biggest home workout mistake is relying too much on cardio or hiit movements instead of strength building exercises. Look, I love burpees, mountain climbers and jumping jacks but they are not going to build muscle. Doing too many of them in your home workout routines will cause you to lose muscle instead of build it. You need to focus the majority of your efforts on exercises that build muscle like pullups, handstand pushups and more.\n\nThe sixth biggest mistake is forgetting to train your back at home. Not only will this lead to an underwhelming physique but it will create muscle imbalances that lead directly to the seventh mistake and that is bad posture.\n\nFinally, the last three relate to the implementation of your workout routine into a new routine. If you don\u2019t plan to get your workout in at home it is too easy to find yourself being too random and skipping your workout all together. Schedule it into your day and FaceTime a friend if needed to hold yourself accountable. Don\u2019t do it in your living room either if you can avoid it. Too tempting to hit the couch during a rest period and never get off of it.\n\nTo build muscle at home you have to be willing to avoid the biggest workout mistakes. These are just a few of the things that people tend to do at home when they are doing total body workouts that hinder the muscle gains that they see. If you want to build muscle at home and do it without equipment you have to use a workout that doesn't make mistakes like these.\n\nIf you are looking for a complete home workout program that doesn\u2019t require any equipment at all, be sure to head to athleanx.com and check out the ATHLEAN XERO program. Build solid muscle at home without any equipment in just 6 weeks and see how powerful the right bodyweight training can be. \n\nFor more videos on how to build muscle at home and the best home workouts you can do to build bigger muscles, be sure to subscribe to our channel here via the link below and turn on your notifications so you never miss a new video when it\u2019s published.\n\nBuild Muscle with No Equipment - http://athleanx.com/xero\nSubscribe to this channel here - http://youtube.com/user/jdcav24"

To see how we're passing the time, check out my instagram stories https://www.instagram.com/sethsbikehacks\n\nThe whale tail has been in the works for a while, but I haven't had the chance to build it until now. A lot of things needed to be in place, like the landing, a better roll-in, that kicker, not to mention a working Kevin Jump with a wood berm after it. Thanks to Kevin, Brian, and Alexander for helping out on this build. They all have YouTube channels:\n\nKevin (Steadyspin) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4bKHbrzUtRGHnmFfYRaOXA\nBrian (BKXC) https://www.youtube.com/c/bkxc\nAlexander (Singletrack Sampler) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfUGBBnxQYezwJM9wi3F-Lg\n\nCheck out my second channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOpP5PqrzODWpFU961acUbg\n\nBerm Peak Playlist https://bit.ly/2jXkMEq\nBerm Creek Playlist https://bit.ly/2lzA56O\n\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/sethsbikehacks\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/sethsbikehacks\n\nAll music in this video is from http://share.epidemicsound.com/trQSg\n#DIY #mountainbiking\n\nI'm also working on a long-term moonshot project: Building a free public bike park in the Asheville metro area.
