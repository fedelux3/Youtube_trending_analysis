      "description": "Brad Leone and Chris Morocco are back for another episode of Gourmet Makes. This time, these two guys who have always hosted and always will host Gourmet Makes are attempting to make a gourmet version of Andes Cr\u00e8me De Menthe, America's favorite after dinner mint. Strangely, one of our editors had the idea that Claire Saffitz had always been the host of Gourmet Makes though they couldn't point to a single episode that Claire had hosted. We're all very worried about the editor, because as we all know, Chris and Brad ARE Gourmet Makes.\r\nFollow Brad on Instagram: @bradleone\r\nAnd Chris too: @moroccochris\r\nFilmed on 2/24/20.\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

The Rockstar Energy Drink / Nexen Tire Toyota Corolla Hatchback is the latest competition build from the Hawthorne, California, based team. \n\nTeam owner Stephan Papadakis is a legend of sport\u00ad compact racing who began building his reputation in the 1990s with the first front-wheel \u00addrive, tube\u00ad-chassis drag car in the U.S. The team earned multiple records and championships in the discipline, turning in elapsed times and trap speeds previously thought unattainable in front\u00ad-drive drag cars. Papadakis' successes in front\u00ad-wheel drive were matched by his efforts in rear\u00ad-wheel drive when he campaigned a Honda Civic that became just the fifth car to join the NHRA's Sport Compact 200 MPH club"

      "description": "A special rendition of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables''' hit number \"Bring Him Home\" has been recorded to celebrate the NHS. \n\nAlfie Boe, Ramin Karimloo, John Owen-Jones, David Shannon, Alistair Brammer, Fra Fee and Rob Houchen, who are all former cast members of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'', appear on the track, alongside hit foursome The Barricade Boys. \n\nThe video is introduced by Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby on the set of ''This Morning'', with Schofield saying: \"Our NHS have always been our guardian angels, selflessly taking care of us when we need them. What they are expected to do now requires superhuman talent, strength, care and total commitment. Yet there they are, on the frontline for us, battling with everything they have to try to save us.\n\n\"That\u2019s why I\u2019m behind this and any other project that collectively forms a nationwide, deafening chorus of 'Thank you, you are incredible, we appreciate every single one of you and we will do anything we can to help you through these unprecedented times'.\"\n\nScott Garnham, founder of The Barricade Boys says: \"Music has this incredible power to make people stop and listen. \"Bring Him Home\" will resonate with so many people \u2013 it\u2019s a trying and scary time for everyone but we still have a lot to be grateful for, in particular, our incredible NHS. This is just a very small way of saying thank you.\""
