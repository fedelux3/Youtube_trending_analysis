Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! \n\nOn this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes \u201cgimmicky\u201d golf clubs.

The Rockstar Energy Drink / Nexen Tire Toyota Corolla Hatchback is the latest competition build from the Hawthorne, California, based team. \n\nTeam owner Stephan Papadakis is a legend of sport\u00ad compact racing who began building his reputation in the 1990s with the first front-wheel \u00addrive, tube\u00ad-chassis drag car in the U.S. The team earned multiple records and championships in the discipline, turning in elapsed times and trap speeds previously thought unattainable in front\u00ad-drive drag cars. Papadakis' successes in front\u00ad-wheel drive were matched by his efforts in rear\u00ad-wheel drive when he campaigned a Honda Civic that became just the fifth car to join the NHRA's Sport Compact 200 MPH club"

What they are expected to do now requires superhuman talent, strength, care and total commitment. Yet there they are, on the frontline for us, battling with everything they have to try to save us.\n\n\"That\u2019s why I\u2019m behind this and any other project that collectively forms a nationwide, deafening chorus of 'Thank you, you are incredible, we appreciate every single one of you and we will do anything we can to help you through these unprecedented times'.\"\n\nScott Garnham, founder of The Barricade Boys says: \"Music has this incredible power to make people stop and listen. \"Bring Him Home\" will resonate with so many people \u2013 it\u2019s a trying and scary time for everyone but we still have a lot to be grateful for, in particular, our incredible NHS. This is just a very small way of saying thank you.\""

I am not in ANY way obligated to mention these products and if I have done so, it is because I genuinely like them. I would NEVER talk about or show something I didn't genuinely love.\n\nSometimes, I may be sponsored by brands for videos. I turn down 90% of sponsorship opportunities. I will not accept unless I love the brand/product already. All products/items will still have been chosen by myself, and the video concept will always be my own idea. I would never endorse a brand/product that I didn't truly love and believe in.\n\nI use affiliate links in the description box of this channel. This means I earn a very small percentage when you purchase a product I recommend- the same way a sales associate in a store earns commission when they help you select a product. This does not in any way affect the price you pay for the item, and absolutely does not influence my choice of items to show you. \n\nLots of love,\n\nFreds x\n\n#selfisolation #lockdown #stayhome #isolation"

      "description": "The backyard dirt jumps are looking amazing. I've built what could be a full line of trails ready to be ridden on MTB or BMX. Right now the jumps aren't massive but now I've built these important two hip jumps, the speed won't be such an issue and the new dirt jumps will be massive! I've promised to build a whatetail feature in the next trail building video. thanks for all the support and unreal comments. Keep them coming and enjoy this episode of my garden trails & pit bike track and see you soon for more trail building progress!"
