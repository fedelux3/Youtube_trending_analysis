      "description": "Doing home workouts can seem like a bad idea to those who fear losing all of their muscle gains by training away from the gym. In this video, I\u2019m going to show you that this is not something to be fearful of as long as you avoid these 10 most common home workout mistakes. In fact, it is possible to build muscle at home with little to no equipment if you get all of these right. So that said, let\u2019s dive in and start making sure you are.\n\nFirst, you must not focus so much on the equipment that you don\u2019t have and instead look around at the opportunities you do have. I covered in a recent home workout video how you have countertops, stairs, doorways, hardwood floors and even tables that you can use to get a complete total body workout with nothing but your own bodyweight. Watch that if you feel like you are out of ideas for what to do now that your gym is closed.\n\nNext, in a rush to overcompensate for the lack of a gym people will attempt to do home workouts and exercises that are simply too difficult for them. What happens here is that they either get hurt or just become discouraged when the results aren\u2019t satisfactory. This is because they would have gotten much more out of doing the exercises that were appropriate for them and that they had done with proper form and intensity.\n\nThird, exercise variety is key when it comes to training at home. This is not because you are trying to create muscle confusion or \u201cshock the muscles\u201d. Instead, this is because the variety of home exercises is what provides the easiest path for overload. Slight changes to the same exercise can provide a totally unique stimulus to the muscles you are trying to train and lead to new muscle gains.\n\nSpeaking of overload, the fourth mistake relates to how many will program for it in the form of specific rep counts with home and bodyweight workouts. This is a mistake. One size does not fit all when it comes to calisthenics. Instead, train to failure or just shy to ensure that you are neither underserving or over serving your abilities in your workouts.\n\nThe fifth biggest home workout mistake is relying too much on cardio or hiit movements instead of strength building exercises. Look, I love burpees, mountain climbers and jumping jacks but they are not going to build muscle. Doing too many of them in your home workout routines will cause you to lose muscle instead of build it. You need to focus the majority of your efforts on exercises that build muscle like pullups, handstand pushups and more.\n\nThe sixth biggest mistake is forgetting to train your back at home. Not only will this lead to an underwhelming physique but it will create muscle imbalances that lead directly to the seventh mistake and that is bad posture.\n\nFinally, the last three relate to the implementation of your workout routine into a new routine. If you don\u2019t plan to get your workout in at home it is too easy to find yourself being too random and skipping your workout all together. Schedule it into your day and FaceTime a friend if needed to hold yourself accountable. Don\u2019t do it in your living room either if you can avoid it. Too tempting to hit the couch during a rest period and never get off of it.\n\nTo build muscle at home you have to be willing to avoid the biggest workout mistakes. These are just a few of the things that people tend to do at home when they are doing total body workouts that hinder the muscle gains that they see.

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.\r\n\r\nFittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right\u2014within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he\u2019s only only getting better with time."

To see how we're passing the time, check out my instagram stories https://www.instagram.com/sethsbikehacks\n\nThe whale tail has been in the works for a while, but I haven't had the chance to build it until now. A lot of things needed to be in place, like the landing, a better roll-in, that kicker, not to mention a working Kevin Jump with a wood berm after it. Thanks to Kevin, Brian, and Alexander for helping out on this build.

Soooooo since everyone is stuck inside for a bit, I thought I\u2019d try to help out and give you guys some ideas for fun and easy art and craft things that you can do at home.

I hope you guys enjoy the video and get some ideas for things to do when you are bored!\n Get read for painting on things, drawing, art challenges, organization/craft room cleanup, bedazzling, old sketchbooks anddd maybe some bad art \ud83d\ude02 \n\nCheck out also my 5 minute crafts to do when you are bored:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqBC2eSV4P4&list=PL807ptvhwHpfasqucgRl4wFRA9qFDyhrV&ab_channel=MoriahElizabeth\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK:\nhttps://amzn.to/2vUerfI\n\nCREATE THIS BOOK 2:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f\n\n\n\n___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________\r\n\r\nHey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh \ud83d\ude02 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

      "description": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is cracking down on cross-country travel by imposing new restrictions on domestic travel. As Abigail Bimman reports, while Trudeau said Canadians' efforts are helping to curb the spread, more still needs to be done. \n\nMeanwhile, Jennifer Johnson reports on the staggering statistics that reveal one person is dying every 17 minutes in New York, as the U.S. scrambles to source medical supplies to slow the spread of the pandemic.\n\nEurope has passed two grim COVID-19 milestones, after the continent reported twenty thousand deaths linked to the virus, half of which occurred in Italy. As Redmond Shannon explains, while several countries have already imposed lockdowns, these measures are expected to become even more severe. \n\nThe Bank of Canada dropped its key lending rate in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a nationwide drop in mortgage rates. As Robin Gill reports, the pandemic is forcing realtors to adapt to cooling sales in recently hot markets. \n\nAs the world responds to the COVID-19 pandemic, people around the world are adjusting to the strict social distancing measures imposed, including self-isolation. Reggie Cecchini looks at how people are passing the time. \n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/6745733/trudeau-coronavirus-update-march-28/\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\r\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\r\nFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\r\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\r\n#GlobalNews #cdnpoli #COVID19 #Coronavirus"
