The Rockstar Energy Drink / Nexen Tire Toyota Corolla Hatchback is the latest competition build from the Hawthorne, California, based team. \n\nTeam owner Stephan Papadakis is a legend of sport\u00ad compact racing who began building his reputation in the 1990s with the first front-wheel \u00addrive, tube\u00ad-chassis drag car in the U.S. The team earned multiple records and championships in the discipline, turning in elapsed times and trap speeds previously thought unattainable in front\u00ad-drive drag cars. Papadakis' successes in front\u00ad-wheel drive were matched by his efforts in rear\u00ad-wheel drive when he campaigned a Honda Civic that became just the fifth car to join the NHRA's Sport Compact 200 MPH club"

This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! \n\nI specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. \n\nI also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. \nI will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! \n\nOn this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes \u201cgimmicky\u201d golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. \n\nIf you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video."
