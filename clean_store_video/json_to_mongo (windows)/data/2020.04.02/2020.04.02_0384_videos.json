Plus they\u2019re making a 4FT Snickers bar, massive Butterfinger, and other epic real chocolate vs sour gummy food like you\u2019ve never seen before.

Today brothers (not twins) the key bros compete to make giant edible donuts, Wonka Nerds Ropes, and Kinder Eggs 1000x their normal size. And try not to laugh at the end as Collins and Devan bite, taste, and try their creations. Trying and testing these foods are so much fun!

The Rockstar Energy Drink / Nexen Tire Toyota Corolla Hatchback is the latest competition build from the Hawthorne, California, based team. \n\nTeam owner Stephan Papadakis is a legend of sport\u00ad compact racing who began building his reputation in the 1990s with the first front-wheel \u00addrive, tube\u00ad-chassis drag car in the U.S. The team earned multiple records and championships in the discipline, turning in elapsed times and trap speeds previously thought unattainable in front\u00ad-drive drag cars. Papadakis' successes in front\u00ad-wheel drive were matched by his efforts in rear\u00ad-wheel drive when he campaigned a Honda Civic that became just the fifth car to join the NHRA's Sport Compact 200 MPH club"
