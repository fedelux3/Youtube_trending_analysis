This time, these two guys who have always hosted and always will host Gourmet Makes are attempting to make a gourmet version of Andes Cr\u00e8me De Menthe, America's favorite after dinner mint. Strangely, one of our editors had the idea that Claire Saffitz had always been the host of Gourmet Makes though they couldn't point to a single episode that Claire had hosted. We're all very worried about the editor, because as we all know, Chris and Brad ARE Gourmet Makes.\r\nFollow Brad on Instagram: @bradleone\r\nAnd Chris too: @moroccochris\r\nFilmed on 2/24/20.\n\nWant Bon App\u00e9tit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to Bon App\u00e9tit on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon App\u00e9tit in your life?

Instead, Steve-O brought his antics to Gordon's kitchen while trying to do his best to keep up with Gordon. Needless to say, Steve-O came ready to have some fun....knives, hot sauce and all! His final dish and crazy stories are something some of us can relate to. \n\nFollow Steve-O on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/user/steveo\nGet Steve-O's Hot Sauce here: https://hotsauceforyourbutthole.com/ \n\nGet the full recipe here: https://www.gordonramsay.com/gr/recipes/southwesternomelette \n\nFollow Gordon: \nText him: +1 (310) 620-6468\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gordongram\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gordonramsay\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/GordonRamsay"

Plus they\u2019re making a 4FT Snickers bar, massive Butterfinger, and other epic real chocolate vs sour gummy food like you\u2019ve never seen before.

Today brothers (not twins) the key bros compete to make giant edible donuts, Wonka Nerds Ropes, and Kinder Eggs 1000x their normal size. And try not to laugh at the end as Collins and Devan bite, taste, and try their creations. Trying and testing these foods are so much fun!
