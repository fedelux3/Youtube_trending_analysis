But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Cultivate a relationship with intention and learn to let it guide the way. Your intention has the power to directly influence the quality of your practice and your connection to yourself. Pro-tip - make your breath a priority. Learning to be disciplined about intention brings purpose to your practice. It also keeps your body safe, your mind more at ease, and opens up the gates for whatever you are moving toward - to come and meet you, just where you are. When this happens you may find yourself feeling more aligned with the process, and in a happy flow state - no matter what your day is like or what exactly goes down on the yoga mat.

Nicolas Pepe fired us ahead with a first-time finish after Sead Kolasinac and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had cut Manchester United open down our left. Kolasinac made a storming run from left-back and stayed onside to receive a return pass from our captain before cutting the ball back for Pepe to finish. Pepe, now full of confidence, tricked his way into the box to set up Aubameyang for a volley over the bar, and Alex Lacazette miscued a shot after turning past Harry Maguire. You sensed we needed a second goal - especially after how Sunday's game against Chelsea panned out - and it arrived just before half-time. Pepe was the provider with an excellent corner delivery, Lacazette's flicked header was pushed out by David de Gea, and Sokratis was on hand to volley into the roof of the net. We were rather more circumspect after the break, happy to play on the break while United probed for a goal that would bring them back into the game. But they never got it, thanks largely to a gutsy rearguard action that was epitomised by the tigerish Lucas Torreira in front of defence. Three points, and a corner turned. This was the perfect start to 2020.#arsenal #nicolaspepe #mikelartetaFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial"

The chefs were amazing, master of fire, and ratios. No recipes are used in their cooking, it’s just experience, and the knowledge of ingredients and method. I was impressed at how the head chef knew all the ingredients, and how much of what to be added where, all while keeping track of all the different dishes prepared.After the first preparation of the biryani, we then enjoyed breakfast - Kerala style “chicken parts,” curry. Including chicken parts and ovary eggs, it was outstanding.Later, in the middle of the day, the housewarming biryani celebration began. Guests started arriving, all lining up for a taste of this special Malabar Coast, Indian biryani.Thalassery Biryani (Malabar Biryani) - Much different from any other biryani I’ve had anywhere else in India or the world, the rice in Thalassery Biryani just melts in your mouth and goes down so easily. It was so moist and juicy, and the flavor and spices were perfect.Having the privilege to attend a housewarming Indian food celebration in Kerala was truly an honor. Thank you to the family who hosted us, and wishing you all the best.Thanks to Ebbin Jose who helped arrange our amazing trip in Kerala.

Here I’m going to show you why you not only want to stop trying to touch your toes and instead do the move I show you as an alternative. All you have to do is look at the implications this position has for hiding postural flows and imbalances and you will see quickly why it’s something you will not want to keep doing to help you feel more flexible.It starts by letting you test yourself. Can you actually touch your toes? Many people will be able to, but many more will not. Even if you cannot, I can make it much easier for you if I tell you to be sure you roll your butt underneath you before you attempt to bend down. This will place a lot less of a stretch on the hamstrings making it easier for you to fold.The issue with this modification is that many people do this naturally anyway in order to cheat their way to their toes. This really isn’t giving them any valuable information regarding their own flexibility and the health of their posture. In fact, it’s doing them a disservice by convincing them that they are more flexible than they really are and therefore allowing them to shrug off doing anything about it.When you slump forward to touch your toes you are actually initiating much of the range of motion through the thoracic spine. You are flexing forward into severe kyphosis in order to achieve the hands to the toes position. This is only reinforcing a bad tendency for having slumped posture. It gets worse from there however. The low back is forced to round and the pelvis is thrown into a posterior tilt. This is the exact position that someone who is aged and has lost all semblance of good posture will adopt.Even more, the shoulders themselves slump forward and are lacking any kind of scapular stability. All of these issues combined are a recipe for disaster when it comes to proper posture and the insinuation that being able to get into this position of hands to toes is in some way a good thing is misleading to say the least. Instead of being obsessed with whether you can still touch your toes I’m asking you to try something else.Stand about 3 foot lengths away from the wall and reach forward with one leg until you can prop your toes up against the wall.  Immediately, you should feel a stretch on the calf of that leg and likely already the hamstring. From here, reach your hands up against the wall slightly over shoulder height and place your palms flat against the wall. Simultaneously walk your hands up the wall while leaning your chest in. The goal should be to ultimately touch your chest against the wall without any care towards whether you are bending down or forward. You are simply supposed to reach your chest forward. If you cannot get there, don’t worry, this is normal. You will however want to work towards getting your chest closer over time. Hold this position for 30 seconds to a minute and don’t forget to repeat on the other leg to balance out both hamstrings.The benefit to this position rather than the slumped forward posture that bending over to touch your toes places you in is the fact that you can maintain thoracic extension while at the same time keeping your pelvis in an anterior tilt. This position of the pelvis is going to place a higher demand on the hamstrings, however in doing so, will reveal any tightnesses in them that you will want to address rather than hiding them by simply allowing your pelvis to roll back during the stretch.This is just one example where old school methods of measuring and working on your flexibility are not helping you.

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Cultivate a relationship with intention and learn to let it guide the way. Your intention has the power to directly influence the quality of your practice and your connection to yourself. Pro-tip - make your breath a priority. Learning to be disciplined about intention brings purpose to your practice. It also keeps your body safe, your mind more at ease, and opens up the gates for whatever you are moving toward - to come and meet you, just where you are. When this happens you may find yourself feeling more aligned with the process, and in a happy flow state - no matter what your day is like or what exactly goes down on the yoga mat.

Nicolas Pepe fired us ahead with a first-time finish after Sead Kolasinac and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had cut Manchester United open down our left. Kolasinac made a storming run from left-back and stayed onside to receive a return pass from our captain before cutting the ball back for Pepe to finish. Pepe, now full of confidence, tricked his way into the box to set up Aubameyang for a volley over the bar, and Alex Lacazette miscued a shot after turning past Harry Maguire. You sensed we needed a second goal - especially after how Sunday's game against Chelsea panned out - and it arrived just before half-time. Pepe was the provider with an excellent corner delivery, Lacazette's flicked header was pushed out by David de Gea, and Sokratis was on hand to volley into the roof of the net. We were rather more circumspect after the break, happy to play on the break while United probed for a goal that would bring them back into the game. But they never got it, thanks largely to a gutsy rearguard action that was epitomised by the tigerish Lucas Torreira in front of defence. Three points, and a corner turned.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial"

The chefs were amazing, master of fire, and ratios. No recipes are used in their cooking, it’s just experience, and the knowledge of ingredients and method. I was impressed at how the head chef knew all the ingredients, and how much of what to be added where, all while keeping track of all the different dishes prepared.After the first preparation of the biryani, we then enjoyed breakfast - Kerala style “chicken parts,” curry. Including chicken parts and ovary eggs, it was outstanding.Later, in the middle of the day, the housewarming biryani celebration began. Guests started arriving, all lining up for a taste of this special Malabar Coast, Indian biryani.Thalassery Biryani (Malabar Biryani) - Much different from any other biryani I’ve had anywhere else in India or the world, the rice in Thalassery Biryani just melts in your mouth and goes down so easily. It was so moist and juicy, and the flavor and spices were perfect.Having the privilege to attend a housewarming Indian food celebration in Kerala was truly an honor.

Here I’m going to show you why you not only want to stop trying to touch your toes and instead do the move I show you as an alternative. All you have to do is look at the implications this position has for hiding postural flows and imbalances and you will see quickly why it’s something you will not want to keep doing to help you feel more flexible.It starts by letting you test yourself. Can you actually touch your toes? Many people will be able to, but many more will not. Even if you cannot, I can make it much easier for you if I tell you to be sure you roll your butt underneath you before you attempt to bend down. This will place a lot less of a stretch on the hamstrings making it easier for you to fold.The issue with this modification is that many people do this naturally anyway in order to cheat their way to their toes. This really isn’t giving them any valuable information regarding their own flexibility and the health of their posture. In fact, it’s doing them a disservice by convincing them that they are more flexible than they really are and therefore allowing them to shrug off doing anything about it.When you slump forward to touch your toes you are actually initiating much of the range of motion through the thoracic spine. You are flexing forward into severe kyphosis in order to achieve the hands to the toes position. This is only reinforcing a bad tendency for having slumped posture. It gets worse from there however. The low back is forced to round and the pelvis is thrown into a posterior tilt. This is the exact position that someone who is aged and has lost all semblance of good posture will adopt.Even more, the shoulders themselves slump forward and are lacking any kind of scapular stability. All of these issues combined are a recipe for disaster when it comes to proper posture and the insinuation that being able to get into this position of hands to toes is in some way a good thing is misleading to say the least. Instead of being obsessed with whether you can still touch your toes I’m asking you to try something else.Stand about 3 foot lengths away from the wall and reach forward with one leg until you can prop your toes up against the wall.  Immediately, you should feel a stretch on the calf of that leg and likely already the hamstring. From here, reach your hands up against the wall slightly over shoulder height and place your palms flat against the wall. Simultaneously walk your hands up the wall while leaning your chest in. The goal should be to ultimately touch your chest against the wall without any care towards whether you are bending down or forward. You are simply supposed to reach your chest forward. If you cannot get there, don’t worry, this is normal. You will however want to work towards getting your chest closer over time. Hold this position for 30 seconds to a minute and don’t forget to repeat on the other leg to balance out both hamstrings.The benefit to this position rather than the slumped forward posture that bending over to touch your toes places you in is the fact that you can maintain thoracic extension while at the same time keeping your pelvis in an anterior tilt. This position of the pelvis is going to place a higher demand on the hamstrings, however in doing so, will reveal any tightnesses in them that you will want to address rather than hiding them by simply allowing your pelvis to roll back during the stretch.This is just one example where old school methods of measuring and working on your flexibility are not helping you.

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Cultivate a relationship with intention and learn to let it guide the way. Your intention has the power to directly influence the quality of your practice and your connection to yourself. Pro-tip - make your breath a priority. Learning to be disciplined about intention brings purpose to your practice. It also keeps your body safe, your mind more at ease, and opens up the gates for whatever you are moving toward - to come and meet you, just where you are. When this happens you may find yourself feeling more aligned with the process, and in a happy flow state - no matter what your day is like or what exactly goes down on the yoga mat.

With that said, this will always be the baby oil fat bike and it will always have baby oil in the brakes until they fail. Maybe it's time we name this bike...

Nicolas Pepe fired us ahead with a first-time finish after Sead Kolasinac and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had cut Manchester United open down our left. Kolasinac made a storming run from left-back and stayed onside to receive a return pass from our captain before cutting the ball back for Pepe to finish. Pepe, now full of confidence, tricked his way into the box to set up Aubameyang for a volley over the bar, and Alex Lacazette miscued a shot after turning past Harry Maguire. You sensed we needed a second goal - especially after how Sunday's game against Chelsea panned out - and it arrived just before half-time. Pepe was the provider with an excellent corner delivery, Lacazette's flicked header was pushed out by David de Gea, and Sokratis was on hand to volley into the roof of the net. We were rather more circumspect after the break, happy to play on the break while United probed for a goal that would bring them back into the game. But they never got it, thanks largely to a gutsy rearguard action that was epitomised by the tigerish Lucas Torreira in front of defence. Three points, and a corner turned. This was the perfect start to 2020.#arsenal #nicolaspepe #mikelartetaFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial"

The chefs were amazing, master of fire, and ratios. No recipes are used in their cooking, it’s just experience, and the knowledge of ingredients and method. I was impressed at how the head chef knew all the ingredients, and how much of what to be added where, all while keeping track of all the different dishes prepared.After the first preparation of the biryani, we then enjoyed breakfast - Kerala style “chicken parts,” curry. Including chicken parts and ovary eggs, it was outstanding.Later, in the middle of the day, the housewarming biryani celebration began. Guests started arriving, all lining up for a taste of this special Malabar Coast, Indian biryani.Thalassery Biryani (Malabar Biryani) - Much different from any other biryani I’ve had anywhere else in India or the world, the rice in Thalassery Biryani just melts in your mouth and goes down so easily. It was so moist and juicy, and the flavor and spices were perfect.Having the privilege to attend a housewarming Indian food celebration in Kerala was truly an honor. Thank you to the family who hosted us, and wishing you all the best.Thanks to Ebbin Jose who helped arrange our amazing trip in Kerala.

Here I’m going to show you why you not only want to stop trying to touch your toes and instead do the move I show you as an alternative. All you have to do is look at the implications this position has for hiding postural flows and imbalances and you will see quickly why it’s something you will not want to keep doing to help you feel more flexible.It starts by letting you test yourself. Can you actually touch your toes? Many people will be able to, but many more will not. Even if you cannot, I can make it much easier for you if I tell you to be sure you roll your butt underneath you before you attempt to bend down. This will place a lot less of a stretch on the hamstrings making it easier for you to fold.The issue with this modification is that many people do this naturally anyway in order to cheat their way to their toes. This really isn’t giving them any valuable information regarding their own flexibility and the health of their posture. In fact, it’s doing them a disservice by convincing them that they are more flexible than they really are and therefore allowing them to shrug off doing anything about it.When you slump forward to touch your toes you are actually initiating much of the range of motion through the thoracic spine. You are flexing forward into severe kyphosis in order to achieve the hands to the toes position. This is only reinforcing a bad tendency for having slumped posture. It gets worse from there however. The low back is forced to round and the pelvis is thrown into a posterior tilt. This is the exact position that someone who is aged and has lost all semblance of good posture will adopt.Even more, the shoulders themselves slump forward and are lacking any kind of scapular stability. All of these issues combined are a recipe for disaster when it comes to proper posture and the insinuation that being able to get into this position of hands to toes is in some way a good thing is misleading to say the least. Instead of being obsessed with whether you can still touch your toes I’m asking you to try something else.Stand about 3 foot lengths away from the wall and reach forward with one leg until you can prop your toes up against the wall.  Immediately, you should feel a stretch on the calf of that leg and likely already the hamstring. From here, reach your hands up against the wall slightly over shoulder height and place your palms flat against the wall. Simultaneously walk your hands up the wall while leaning your chest in. The goal should be to ultimately touch your chest against the wall without any care towards whether you are bending down or forward. You are simply supposed to reach your chest forward. If you cannot get there, don’t worry, this is normal. You will however want to work towards getting your chest closer over time. Hold this position for 30 seconds to a minute and don’t forget to repeat on the other leg to balance out both hamstrings.The benefit to this position rather than the slumped forward posture that bending over to touch your toes places you in is the fact that you can maintain thoracic extension while at the same time keeping your pelvis in an anterior tilt. This position of the pelvis is going to place a higher demand on the hamstrings, however in doing so, will reveal any tightnesses in them that you will want to address rather than hiding them by simply allowing your pelvis to roll back during the stretch.This is just one example where old school methods of measuring and working on your flexibility are not helping you.

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong.

Cultivate a relationship with intention and learn to let it guide the way. Your intention has the power to directly influence the quality of your practice and your connection to yourself. Pro-tip - make your breath a priority. Learning to be disciplined about intention brings purpose to your practice. It also keeps your body safe, your mind more at ease, and opens up the gates for whatever you are moving toward - to come and meet you, just where you are. When this happens you may find yourself feeling more aligned with the process, and in a happy flow state - no matter what your day is like or what exactly goes down on the yoga mat.

Nicolas Pepe fired us ahead with a first-time finish after Sead Kolasinac and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had cut Manchester United open down our left. Kolasinac made a storming run from left-back and stayed onside to receive a return pass from our captain before cutting the ball back for Pepe to finish. Pepe, now full of confidence, tricked his way into the box to set up Aubameyang for a volley over the bar, and Alex Lacazette miscued a shot after turning past Harry Maguire. You sensed we needed a second goal - especially after how Sunday's game against Chelsea panned out - and it arrived just before half-time. Pepe was the provider with an excellent corner delivery, Lacazette's flicked header was pushed out by David de Gea, and Sokratis was on hand to volley into the roof of the net. We were rather more circumspect after the break, happy to play on the break while United probed for a goal that would bring them back into the game. But they never got it, thanks largely to a gutsy rearguard action that was epitomised by the tigerish Lucas Torreira in front of defence. Three points, and a corner turned. This was the perfect start to 2020.#arsenal #nicolaspepe #mikelartetaFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial"

The chefs were amazing, master of fire, and ratios. No recipes are used in their cooking, it’s just experience, and the knowledge of ingredients and method. I was impressed at how the head chef knew all the ingredients, and how much of what to be added where, all while keeping track of all the different dishes prepared.After the first preparation of the biryani, we then enjoyed breakfast - Kerala style “chicken parts,” curry. Including chicken parts and ovary eggs, it was outstanding.Later, in the middle of the day, the housewarming biryani celebration began. Guests started arriving, all lining up for a taste of this special Malabar Coast, Indian biryani.Thalassery Biryani (Malabar Biryani) - Much different from any other biryani I’ve had anywhere else in India or the world, the rice in Thalassery Biryani just melts in your mouth and goes down so easily. It was so moist and juicy, and the flavor and spices were perfect.Having the privilege to attend a housewarming Indian food celebration in Kerala was truly an honor. Thank you to the family who hosted us, and wishing you all the best.Thanks to Ebbin Jose who helped arrange our amazing trip in Kerala.

Here I’m going to show you why you not only want to stop trying to touch your toes and instead do the move I show you as an alternative. All you have to do is look at the implications this position has for hiding postural flows and imbalances and you will see quickly why it’s something you will not want to keep doing to help you feel more flexible.It starts by letting you test yourself. Can you actually touch your toes? Many people will be able to, but many more will not. Even if you cannot, I can make it much easier for you if I tell you to be sure you roll your butt underneath you before you attempt to bend down. This will place a lot less of a stretch on the hamstrings making it easier for you to fold.The issue with this modification is that many people do this naturally anyway in order to cheat their way to their toes. This really isn’t giving them any valuable information regarding their own flexibility and the health of their posture. In fact, it’s doing them a disservice by convincing them that they are more flexible than they really are and therefore allowing them to shrug off doing anything about it.When you slump forward to touch your toes you are actually initiating much of the range of motion through the thoracic spine. You are flexing forward into severe kyphosis in order to achieve the hands to the toes position. This is only reinforcing a bad tendency for having slumped posture. It gets worse from there however. The low back is forced to round and the pelvis is thrown into a posterior tilt. This is the exact position that someone who is aged and has lost all semblance of good posture will adopt.Even more, the shoulders themselves slump forward and are lacking any kind of scapular stability. All of these issues combined are a recipe for disaster when it comes to proper posture and the insinuation that being able to get into this position of hands to toes is in some way a good thing is misleading to say the least. Instead of being obsessed with whether you can still touch your toes I’m asking you to try something else.Stand about 3 foot lengths away from the wall and reach forward with one leg until you can prop your toes up against the wall.  Immediately, you should feel a stretch on the calf of that leg and likely already the hamstring. From here, reach your hands up against the wall slightly over shoulder height and place your palms flat against the wall. Simultaneously walk your hands up the wall while leaning your chest in. The goal should be to ultimately touch your chest against the wall without any care towards whether you are bending down or forward. You are simply supposed to reach your chest forward. If you cannot get there, don’t worry, this is normal. You will however want to work towards getting your chest closer over time. Hold this position for 30 seconds to a minute and don’t forget to repeat on the other leg to balance out both hamstrings.The benefit to this position rather than the slumped forward posture that bending over to touch your toes places you in is the fact that you can maintain thoracic extension while at the same time keeping your pelvis in an anterior tilt. This position of the pelvis is going to place a higher demand on the hamstrings, however in doing so, will reveal any tightnesses in them that you will want to address rather than hiding them by simply allowing your pelvis to roll back during the stretch.This is just one example where old school methods of measuring and working on your flexibility are not helping you.

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Cultivate a relationship with intention and learn to let it guide the way. Your intention has the power to directly influence the quality of your practice and your connection to yourself. Pro-tip - make your breath a priority. Learning to be disciplined about intention brings purpose to your practice. It also keeps your body safe, your mind more at ease, and opens up the gates for whatever you are moving toward - to come and meet you, just where you are. When this happens you may find yourself feeling more aligned with the process, and in a happy flow state - no matter what your day is like or what exactly goes down on the yoga mat.

Nicolas Pepe fired us ahead with a first-time finish after Sead Kolasinac and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had cut Manchester United open down our left. Kolasinac made a storming run from left-back and stayed onside to receive a return pass from our captain before cutting the ball back for Pepe to finish. Pepe, now full of confidence, tricked his way into the box to set up Aubameyang for a volley over the bar, and Alex Lacazette miscued a shot after turning past Harry Maguire. You sensed we needed a second goal - especially after how Sunday's game against Chelsea panned out - and it arrived just before half-time. Pepe was the provider with an excellent corner delivery, Lacazette's flicked header was pushed out by David de Gea, and Sokratis was on hand to volley into the roof of the net. We were rather more circumspect after the break, happy to play on the break while United probed for a goal that would bring them back into the game. But they never got it, thanks largely to a gutsy rearguard action that was epitomised by the tigerish Lucas Torreira in front of defence. Three points, and a corner turned. This was the perfect start to 2020.#arsenal #nicolaspepe #mikelartetaFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial"

The chefs were amazing, master of fire, and ratios. No recipes are used in their cooking, it’s just experience, and the knowledge of ingredients and method. I was impressed at how the head chef knew all the ingredients, and how much of what to be added where, all while keeping track of all the different dishes prepared.After the first preparation of the biryani, we then enjoyed breakfast - Kerala style “chicken parts,” curry. Including chicken parts and ovary eggs, it was outstanding.Later, in the middle of the day, the housewarming biryani celebration began. Guests started arriving, all lining up for a taste of this special Malabar Coast, Indian biryani.Thalassery Biryani (Malabar Biryani) - Much different from any other biryani I’ve had anywhere else in India or the world, the rice in Thalassery Biryani just melts in your mouth and goes down so easily. It was so moist and juicy, and the flavor and spices were perfect.Having the privilege to attend a housewarming Indian food celebration in Kerala was truly an honor. Thank you to the family who hosted us, and wishing you all the best.Thanks to Ebbin Jose who helped arrange our amazing trip in Kerala.

Here I’m going to show you why you not only want to stop trying to touch your toes and instead do the move I show you as an alternative. All you have to do is look at the implications this position has for hiding postural flows and imbalances and you will see quickly why it’s something you will not want to keep doing to help you feel more flexible.It starts by letting you test yourself. Can you actually touch your toes? Many people will be able to, but many more will not. Even if you cannot, I can make it much easier for you if I tell you to be sure you roll your butt underneath you before you attempt to bend down. This will place a lot less of a stretch on the hamstrings making it easier for you to fold.The issue with this modification is that many people do this naturally anyway in order to cheat their way to their toes. This really isn’t giving them any valuable information regarding their own flexibility and the health of their posture. In fact, it’s doing them a disservice by convincing them that they are more flexible than they really are and therefore allowing them to shrug off doing anything about it.When you slump forward to touch your toes you are actually initiating much of the range of motion through the thoracic spine. You are flexing forward into severe kyphosis in order to achieve the hands to the toes position. This is only reinforcing a bad tendency for having slumped posture. It gets worse from there however. The low back is forced to round and the pelvis is thrown into a posterior tilt. This is the exact position that someone who is aged and has lost all semblance of good posture will adopt.Even more, the shoulders themselves slump forward and are lacking any kind of scapular stability. All of these issues combined are a recipe for disaster when it comes to proper posture and the insinuation that being able to get into this position of hands to toes is in some way a good thing is misleading to say the least. Instead of being obsessed with whether you can still touch your toes I’m asking you to try something else.Stand about 3 foot lengths away from the wall and reach forward with one leg until you can prop your toes up against the wall.  Immediately, you should feel a stretch on the calf of that leg and likely already the hamstring. From here, reach your hands up against the wall slightly over shoulder height and place your palms flat against the wall. Simultaneously walk your hands up the wall while leaning your chest in. The goal should be to ultimately touch your chest against the wall without any care towards whether you are bending down or forward. You are simply supposed to reach your chest forward. If you cannot get there, don’t worry, this is normal. You will however want to work towards getting your chest closer over time. Hold this position for 30 seconds to a minute and don’t forget to repeat on the other leg to balance out both hamstrings.The benefit to this position rather than the slumped forward posture that bending over to touch your toes places you in is the fact that you can maintain thoracic extension while at the same time keeping your pelvis in an anterior tilt. This position of the pelvis is going to place a higher demand on the hamstrings, however in doing so, will reveal any tightnesses in them that you will want to address rather than hiding them by simply allowing your pelvis to roll back during the stretch.This is just one example where old school methods of measuring and working on your flexibility are not helping you.

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Cultivate a relationship with intention and learn to let it guide the way. Your intention has the power to directly influence the quality of your practice and your connection to yourself. Pro-tip - make your breath a priority. Learning to be disciplined about intention brings purpose to your practice. It also keeps your body safe, your mind more at ease, and opens up the gates for whatever you are moving toward - to come and meet you, just where you are.

Nicolas Pepe fired us ahead with a first-time finish after Sead Kolasinac and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had cut Manchester United open down our left. Kolasinac made a storming run from left-back and stayed onside to receive a return pass from our captain before cutting the ball back for Pepe to finish. Pepe, now full of confidence, tricked his way into the box to set up Aubameyang for a volley over the bar, and Alex Lacazette miscued a shot after turning past Harry Maguire. You sensed we needed a second goal - especially after how Sunday's game against Chelsea panned out - and it arrived just before half-time. Pepe was the provider with an excellent corner delivery, Lacazette's flicked header was pushed out by David de Gea, and Sokratis was on hand to volley into the roof of the net. We were rather more circumspect after the break, happy to play on the break while United probed for a goal that would bring them back into the game. But they never got it, thanks largely to a gutsy rearguard action that was epitomised by the tigerish Lucas Torreira in front of defence. Three points, and a corner turned. This was the perfect start to 2020.#arsenal #nicolaspepe #mikelartetaFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial"

The chefs were amazing, master of fire, and ratios. No recipes are used in their cooking, it’s just experience, and the knowledge of ingredients and method. I was impressed at how the head chef knew all the ingredients, and how much of what to be added where, all while keeping track of all the different dishes prepared.After the first preparation of the biryani, we then enjoyed breakfast - Kerala style “chicken parts,” curry. Including chicken parts and ovary eggs, it was outstanding.Later, in the middle of the day, the housewarming biryani celebration began. Guests started arriving, all lining up for a taste of this special Malabar Coast, Indian biryani.Thalassery Biryani (Malabar Biryani) - Much different from any other biryani I’ve had anywhere else in India or the world, the rice in Thalassery Biryani just melts in your mouth and goes down so easily. It was so moist and juicy, and the flavor and spices were perfect.Having the privilege to attend a housewarming Indian food celebration in Kerala was truly an honor.

Here I’m going to show you why you not only want to stop trying to touch your toes and instead do the move I show you as an alternative. All you have to do is look at the implications this position has for hiding postural flows and imbalances and you will see quickly why it’s something you will not want to keep doing to help you feel more flexible.It starts by letting you test yourself. Can you actually touch your toes? Many people will be able to, but many more will not. Even if you cannot, I can make it much easier for you if I tell you to be sure you roll your butt underneath you before you attempt to bend down. This will place a lot less of a stretch on the hamstrings making it easier for you to fold.The issue with this modification is that many people do this naturally anyway in order to cheat their way to their toes. This really isn’t giving them any valuable information regarding their own flexibility and the health of their posture. In fact, it’s doing them a disservice by convincing them that they are more flexible than they really are and therefore allowing them to shrug off doing anything about it.When you slump forward to touch your toes you are actually initiating much of the range of motion through the thoracic spine. You are flexing forward into severe kyphosis in order to achieve the hands to the toes position. This is only reinforcing a bad tendency for having slumped posture. It gets worse from there however. The low back is forced to round and the pelvis is thrown into a posterior tilt. This is the exact position that someone who is aged and has lost all semblance of good posture will adopt.Even more, the shoulders themselves slump forward and are lacking any kind of scapular stability. All of these issues combined are a recipe for disaster when it comes to proper posture and the insinuation that being able to get into this position of hands to toes is in some way a good thing is misleading to say the least. Instead of being obsessed with whether you can still touch your toes I’m asking you to try something else.Stand about 3 foot lengths away from the wall and reach forward with one leg until you can prop your toes up against the wall.  Immediately, you should feel a stretch on the calf of that leg and likely already the hamstring. From here, reach your hands up against the wall slightly over shoulder height and place your palms flat against the wall. Simultaneously walk your hands up the wall while leaning your chest in. The goal should be to ultimately touch your chest against the wall without any care towards whether you are bending down or forward. You are simply supposed to reach your chest forward. If you cannot get there, don’t worry, this is normal. You will however want to work towards getting your chest closer over time. Hold this position for 30 seconds to a minute and don’t forget to repeat on the other leg to balance out both hamstrings.The benefit to this position rather than the slumped forward posture that bending over to touch your toes places you in is the fact that you can maintain thoracic extension while at the same time keeping your pelvis in an anterior tilt. This position of the pelvis is going to place a higher demand on the hamstrings, however in doing so, will reveal any tightnesses in them that you will want to address rather than hiding them by simply allowing your pelvis to roll back during the stretch.This is just one example where old school methods of measuring and working on your flexibility are not helping you.

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong.

Cultivate a relationship with intention and learn to let it guide the way. Your intention has the power to directly influence the quality of your practice and your connection to yourself. Pro-tip - make your breath a priority. Learning to be disciplined about intention brings purpose to your practice. It also keeps your body safe, your mind more at ease, and opens up the gates for whatever you are moving toward - to come and meet you, just where you are. When this happens you may find yourself feeling more aligned with the process, and in a happy flow state - no matter what your day is like or what exactly goes down on the yoga mat.

Nicolas Pepe fired us ahead with a first-time finish after Sead Kolasinac and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had cut Manchester United open down our left. Kolasinac made a storming run from left-back and stayed onside to receive a return pass from our captain before cutting the ball back for Pepe to finish. Pepe, now full of confidence, tricked his way into the box to set up Aubameyang for a volley over the bar, and Alex Lacazette miscued a shot after turning past Harry Maguire. You sensed we needed a second goal - especially after how Sunday's game against Chelsea panned out - and it arrived just before half-time. Pepe was the provider with an excellent corner delivery, Lacazette's flicked header was pushed out by David de Gea, and Sokratis was on hand to volley into the roof of the net. We were rather more circumspect after the break, happy to play on the break while United probed for a goal that would bring them back into the game. But they never got it, thanks largely to a gutsy rearguard action that was epitomised by the tigerish Lucas Torreira in front of defence. Three points, and a corner turned.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial"

The chefs were amazing, master of fire, and ratios. No recipes are used in their cooking, it’s just experience, and the knowledge of ingredients and method. I was impressed at how the head chef knew all the ingredients, and how much of what to be added where, all while keeping track of all the different dishes prepared.After the first preparation of the biryani, we then enjoyed breakfast - Kerala style “chicken parts,” curry. Including chicken parts and ovary eggs, it was outstanding.Later, in the middle of the day, the housewarming biryani celebration began. Guests started arriving, all lining up for a taste of this special Malabar Coast, Indian biryani.Thalassery Biryani (Malabar Biryani) - Much different from any other biryani I’ve had anywhere else in India or the world, the rice in Thalassery Biryani just melts in your mouth and goes down so easily. It was so moist and juicy, and the flavor and spices were perfect.Having the privilege to attend a housewarming Indian food celebration in Kerala was truly an honor. Thank you to the family who hosted us, and wishing you all the best.Thanks to Ebbin Jose who helped arrange our amazing trip in Kerala.

Here I’m going to show you why you not only want to stop trying to touch your toes and instead do the move I show you as an alternative. All you have to do is look at the implications this position has for hiding postural flows and imbalances and you will see quickly why it’s something you will not want to keep doing to help you feel more flexible.It starts by letting you test yourself. Can you actually touch your toes? Many people will be able to, but many more will not. Even if you cannot, I can make it much easier for you if I tell you to be sure you roll your butt underneath you before you attempt to bend down. This will place a lot less of a stretch on the hamstrings making it easier for you to fold.The issue with this modification is that many people do this naturally anyway in order to cheat their way to their toes. This really isn’t giving them any valuable information regarding their own flexibility and the health of their posture. In fact, it’s doing them a disservice by convincing them that they are more flexible than they really are and therefore allowing them to shrug off doing anything about it.When you slump forward to touch your toes you are actually initiating much of the range of motion through the thoracic spine. You are flexing forward into severe kyphosis in order to achieve the hands to the toes position. This is only reinforcing a bad tendency for having slumped posture. It gets worse from there however. The low back is forced to round and the pelvis is thrown into a posterior tilt. This is the exact position that someone who is aged and has lost all semblance of good posture will adopt.Even more, the shoulders themselves slump forward and are lacking any kind of scapular stability. All of these issues combined are a recipe for disaster when it comes to proper posture and the insinuation that being able to get into this position of hands to toes is in some way a good thing is misleading to say the least. Instead of being obsessed with whether you can still touch your toes I’m asking you to try something else.Stand about 3 foot lengths away from the wall and reach forward with one leg until you can prop your toes up against the wall.  Immediately, you should feel a stretch on the calf of that leg and likely already the hamstring. From here, reach your hands up against the wall slightly over shoulder height and place your palms flat against the wall. Simultaneously walk your hands up the wall while leaning your chest in. The goal should be to ultimately touch your chest against the wall without any care towards whether you are bending down or forward. You are simply supposed to reach your chest forward. If you cannot get there, don’t worry, this is normal. You will however want to work towards getting your chest closer over time. Hold this position for 30 seconds to a minute and don’t forget to repeat on the other leg to balance out both hamstrings.The benefit to this position rather than the slumped forward posture that bending over to touch your toes places you in is the fact that you can maintain thoracic extension while at the same time keeping your pelvis in an anterior tilt. This position of the pelvis is going to place a higher demand on the hamstrings, however in doing so, will reveal any tightnesses in them that you will want to address rather than hiding them by simply allowing your pelvis to roll back during the stretch.This is just one example where old school methods of measuring and working on your flexibility are not helping you.

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Cultivate a relationship with intention and learn to let it guide the way. Your intention has the power to directly influence the quality of your practice and your connection to yourself. Pro-tip - make your breath a priority. Learning to be disciplined about intention brings purpose to your practice. It also keeps your body safe, your mind more at ease, and opens up the gates for whatever you are moving toward - to come and meet you, just where you are. When this happens you may find yourself feeling more aligned with the process, and in a happy flow state - no matter what your day is like or what exactly goes down on the yoga mat.

Nicolas Pepe fired us ahead with a first-time finish after Sead Kolasinac and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had cut Manchester United open down our left. Kolasinac made a storming run from left-back and stayed onside to receive a return pass from our captain before cutting the ball back for Pepe to finish. Pepe, now full of confidence, tricked his way into the box to set up Aubameyang for a volley over the bar, and Alex Lacazette miscued a shot after turning past Harry Maguire. You sensed we needed a second goal - especially after how Sunday's game against Chelsea panned out - and it arrived just before half-time. Pepe was the provider with an excellent corner delivery, Lacazette's flicked header was pushed out by David de Gea, and Sokratis was on hand to volley into the roof of the net. We were rather more circumspect after the break, happy to play on the break while United probed for a goal that would bring them back into the game. But they never got it, thanks largely to a gutsy rearguard action that was epitomised by the tigerish Lucas Torreira in front of defence. Three points, and a corner turned. This was the perfect start to 2020.#arsenal #nicolaspepe #mikelartetaFor more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. ► Follow Alonghttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/https://twitter.com/farmmillennial"

The chefs were amazing, master of fire, and ratios. No recipes are used in their cooking, it’s just experience, and the knowledge of ingredients and method. I was impressed at how the head chef knew all the ingredients, and how much of what to be added where, all while keeping track of all the different dishes prepared.After the first preparation of the biryani, we then enjoyed breakfast - Kerala style “chicken parts,” curry. Including chicken parts and ovary eggs, it was outstanding.Later, in the middle of the day, the housewarming biryani celebration began. Guests started arriving, all lining up for a taste of this special Malabar Coast, Indian biryani.Thalassery Biryani (Malabar Biryani) - Much different from any other biryani I’ve had anywhere else in India or the world, the rice in Thalassery Biryani just melts in your mouth and goes down so easily. It was so moist and juicy, and the flavor and spices were perfect.Having the privilege to attend a housewarming Indian food celebration in Kerala was truly an honor. Thank you to the family who hosted us, and wishing you all the best.Thanks to Ebbin Jose who helped arrange our amazing trip in Kerala.

Here I’m going to show you why you not only want to stop trying to touch your toes and instead do the move I show you as an alternative. All you have to do is look at the implications this position has for hiding postural flows and imbalances and you will see quickly why it’s something you will not want to keep doing to help you feel more flexible.It starts by letting you test yourself. Can you actually touch your toes? Many people will be able to, but many more will not. Even if you cannot, I can make it much easier for you if I tell you to be sure you roll your butt underneath you before you attempt to bend down. This will place a lot less of a stretch on the hamstrings making it easier for you to fold.The issue with this modification is that many people do this naturally anyway in order to cheat their way to their toes. This really isn’t giving them any valuable information regarding their own flexibility and the health of their posture. In fact, it’s doing them a disservice by convincing them that they are more flexible than they really are and therefore allowing them to shrug off doing anything about it.When you slump forward to touch your toes you are actually initiating much of the range of motion through the thoracic spine. You are flexing forward into severe kyphosis in order to achieve the hands to the toes position. This is only reinforcing a bad tendency for having slumped posture. It gets worse from there however. The low back is forced to round and the pelvis is thrown into a posterior tilt. This is the exact position that someone who is aged and has lost all semblance of good posture will adopt.Even more, the shoulders themselves slump forward and are lacking any kind of scapular stability. All of these issues combined are a recipe for disaster when it comes to proper posture and the insinuation that being able to get into this position of hands to toes is in some way a good thing is misleading to say the least. Instead of being obsessed with whether you can still touch your toes I’m asking you to try something else.Stand about 3 foot lengths away from the wall and reach forward with one leg until you can prop your toes up against the wall.  Immediately, you should feel a stretch on the calf of that leg and likely already the hamstring. From here, reach your hands up against the wall slightly over shoulder height and place your palms flat against the wall. Simultaneously walk your hands up the wall while leaning your chest in. The goal should be to ultimately touch your chest against the wall without any care towards whether you are bending down or forward. You are simply supposed to reach your chest forward. If you cannot get there, don’t worry, this is normal. You will however want to work towards getting your chest closer over time. Hold this position for 30 seconds to a minute and don’t forget to repeat on the other leg to balance out both hamstrings.The benefit to this position rather than the slumped forward posture that bending over to touch your toes places you in is the fact that you can maintain thoracic extension while at the same time keeping your pelvis in an anterior tilt. This position of the pelvis is going to place a higher demand on the hamstrings, however in doing so, will reveal any tightnesses in them that you will want to address rather than hiding them by simply allowing your pelvis to roll back during the stretch.This is just one example where old school methods of measuring and working on your flexibility are not helping you.
