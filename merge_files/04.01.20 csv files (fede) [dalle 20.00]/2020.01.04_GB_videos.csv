But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn‚Äôt do much about it.Unless‚Ä¶ we move our whole solar system out of the way.Support us on Patreon so we can make more videos (and get cool stuff in return): https://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt?ty=hSteady: https://steadyhq.com/de/kurzgesagtMerchandise:  https://shop.kurzgesagt.org Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/cRUQxzFacebook: http://bit.ly/1NB6U5OTwitter: http://bit.ly/2DDeT83Instagram: http://bit.ly/2DEN7r3Discord: https://discord.gg/cB7ycdvThe Voice of Kurzgesagt: Steve Taylor: http://voice-pool.com/en/english/The music of the video here: Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/34L3USGBandcamp: https://bit.ly/38YgiC5Youtube: https://bit.ly/2CZ6PeNFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4 THANKS A LOT TO OUR LOVELY PATRONS FOR SUPPORTING US:Patrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, –ò–º—è—è –§–∞–º–∏–ª–∏—è—è, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, M√°t√© Szab√≥, Kasper Kylm√§l√§, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet"

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn‚Äôt do much about it.Unless‚Ä¶ we move our whole solar system out of the way.Support us on Patreon so we can make more videos (and get cool stuff in return): https://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt?ty=hSteady: https://steadyhq.com/de/kurzgesagtMerchandise:  https://shop.kurzgesagt.org Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/cRUQxzFacebook: http://bit.ly/1NB6U5OTwitter: http://bit.ly/2DDeT83Instagram: http://bit.ly/2DEN7r3Discord: https://discord.gg/cB7ycdvThe Voice of Kurzgesagt: Steve Taylor: http://voice-pool.com/en/english/The music of the video here: Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/34L3USGBandcamp: https://bit.ly/38YgiC5Youtube: https://bit.ly/2CZ6PeNFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4 THANKS A LOT TO OUR LOVELY PATRONS FOR SUPPORTING US:Patrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, –ò–º—è—è –§–∞–º–∏–ª–∏—è—è, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, M√°t√© Szab√≥, Kasper Kylm√§l√§, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet"

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong.

With luxury cars it's better to let someone else buy it new and take the huge depreciation hit first. Then you can buy it at an amazing price with low mileage and just a few years old. We wrapped the car with an Indulgent Blue wrap to make it look amazing and we learned how to change the oil in an exotic car to save a ton of money!*All-in-one* used car search website: https://www.AutoTempest.comWhere I got the large model car: https://amzn.to/2Q8ByxzBlue Wrap I got: https://amzn.to/39nBDoQFerrari Motor Oil: https://amzn.to/2Q71lX8Portable Socket Set: https://amzn.to/36aMj8oOil Lab Test Kit: https://www.blackstone-labs.com/Pre Purchase Inspection Checklist: https://goo.gl/uqaWYaI Finally Bought My Dream Car: https://youtu.be/Z5x22ef7A-w‚Üí As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.‚Üí Become a ChrisFix Subscriber: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=paintballoo7‚Üí Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/chrisfixit‚Üí Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/chrisfix8‚Üí Website: http://www.ChrisFixed.com‚Üí My Channel Home Page: https://www.youtube.com/ChrisFix**If the video was helpful, remember to give it a thumbs up and consider subscribing.**Disclaimer:Due to factors beyond the control of ChrisFix, I cannot guarantee against improper use or unauthorized modifications of this information.

We like to make interesting car mods and show you how we've gone about it, but we can't promise that anything we show you will work for your particular car, or that you won't harm yourself, someone else, your car or your warranty doing it. Please be safe, be responsible and unless you know what you're doing, do not fool around with very serious machinery just because you've seen us make it look so easy.

In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn‚Äôt do much about it.Unless‚Ä¶ we move our whole solar system out of the way.Support us on Patreon so we can make more videos (and get cool stuff in return): https://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt?ty=hSteady: https://steadyhq.com/de/kurzgesagtMerchandise:  https://shop.kurzgesagt.org Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/cRUQxzFacebook: http://bit.ly/1NB6U5OTwitter: http://bit.ly/2DDeT83Instagram: http://bit.ly/2DEN7r3Discord: https://discord.gg/cB7ycdvThe Voice of Kurzgesagt: Steve Taylor: http://voice-pool.com/en/english/The music of the video here: Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/34L3USGBandcamp: https://bit.ly/38YgiC5Youtube: https://bit.ly/2CZ6PeNFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4 THANKS A LOT TO OUR LOVELY PATRONS FOR SUPPORTING US:Patrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, –ò–º—è—è –§–∞–º–∏–ª–∏—è—è, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, M√°t√© Szab√≥, Kasper Kylm√§l√§, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet"

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong.

In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn‚Äôt do much about it.Unless‚Ä¶ we move our whole solar system out of the way.Support us on Patreon so we can make more videos (and get cool stuff in return): https://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt?ty=hSteady: https://steadyhq.com/de/kurzgesagtMerchandise:  https://shop.kurzgesagt.org Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/cRUQxzFacebook: http://bit.ly/1NB6U5OTwitter: http://bit.ly/2DDeT83Instagram: http://bit.ly/2DEN7r3Discord: https://discord.gg/cB7ycdvThe Voice of Kurzgesagt: Steve Taylor: http://voice-pool.com/en/english/The music of the video here: Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/34L3USGBandcamp: https://bit.ly/38YgiC5Youtube: https://bit.ly/2CZ6PeNFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4 THANKS A LOT TO OUR LOVELY PATRONS FOR SUPPORTING US:Patrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, –ò–º—è—è –§–∞–º–∏–ª–∏—è—è, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, M√°t√© Szab√≥, Kasper Kylm√§l√§, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet"

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn‚Äôt do much about it.Unless‚Ä¶ we move our whole solar system out of the way.Support us on Patreon so we can make more videos (and get cool stuff in return): https://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt?ty=hSteady: https://steadyhq.com/de/kurzgesagtMerchandise:  https://shop.kurzgesagt.org Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/cRUQxzFacebook: http://bit.ly/1NB6U5OTwitter: http://bit.ly/2DDeT83Instagram: http://bit.ly/2DEN7r3Discord: https://discord.gg/cB7ycdvThe Voice of Kurzgesagt: Steve Taylor: http://voice-pool.com/en/english/The music of the video here: Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/34L3USGBandcamp: https://bit.ly/38YgiC5Youtube: https://bit.ly/2CZ6PeNFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4 THANKS A LOT TO OUR LOVELY PATRONS FOR SUPPORTING US:Patrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, –ò–º—è—è –§–∞–º–∏–ª–∏—è—è, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, M√°t√© Szab√≥, Kasper Kylm√§l√§, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet"

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

I surprised my dad with a new car and he did not expect it at all!  We saved over 75% off of MSRP by not buying it from the dealership! With luxury cars it's better to let someone else buy it new and take the huge depreciation hit first. Then you can buy it at an amazing price with low mileage and just a few years old. We wrapped the car with an Indulgent Blue wrap to make it look amazing and we learned how to change the oil in an exotic car to save a ton of money!*All-in-one* used car search website: https://www.AutoTempest.comWhere I got the large model car: https://amzn.to/2Q8ByxzBlue Wrap I got: https://amzn.to/39nBDoQFerrari Motor Oil: https://amzn.to/2Q71lX8Portable Socket Set: https://amzn.to/36aMj8oOil Lab Test Kit: https://www.blackstone-labs.com/Pre Purchase Inspection Checklist: https://goo.gl/uqaWYaI Finally Bought My Dream Car: https://youtu.be/Z5x22ef7A-w‚Üí As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.‚Üí Become a ChrisFix Subscriber: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=paintballoo7‚Üí Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/chrisfixit‚Üí Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/chrisfix8‚Üí Website: http://www.ChrisFixed.com‚Üí My Channel Home Page: https://www.youtube.com/ChrisFix**If the video was helpful, remember to give it a thumbs up and consider subscribing.**Disclaimer:Due to factors beyond the control of ChrisFix, I cannot guarantee against improper use or unauthorized modifications of this information.

We like to make interesting car mods and show you how we've gone about it, but we can't promise that anything we show you will work for your particular car, or that you won't harm yourself, someone else, your car or your warranty doing it. Please be safe, be responsible and unless you know what you're doing, do not fool around with very serious machinery just because you've seen us make it look so easy.

In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn‚Äôt do much about it.Unless‚Ä¶ we move our whole solar system out of the way.Support us on Patreon so we can make more videos (and get cool stuff in return): https://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt?ty=hSteady: https://steadyhq.com/de/kurzgesagtMerchandise:  https://shop.kurzgesagt.org Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/cRUQxzFacebook: http://bit.ly/1NB6U5OTwitter: http://bit.ly/2DDeT83Instagram: http://bit.ly/2DEN7r3Discord: https://discord.gg/cB7ycdvThe Voice of Kurzgesagt: Steve Taylor: http://voice-pool.com/en/english/The music of the video here: Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/34L3USGBandcamp: https://bit.ly/38YgiC5Youtube: https://bit.ly/2CZ6PeNFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4 THANKS A LOT TO OUR LOVELY PATRONS FOR SUPPORTING US:Patrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, –ò–º—è—è –§–∞–º–∏–ª–∏—è—è, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, M√°t√© Szab√≥, Kasper Kylm√§l√§, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet"

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn‚Äôt do much about it.Unless‚Ä¶ we move our whole solar system out of the way.Support us on Patreon so we can make more videos (and get cool stuff in return): https://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt?ty=hSteady: https://steadyhq.com/de/kurzgesagtMerchandise:  https://shop.kurzgesagt.org Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/cRUQxzFacebook: http://bit.ly/1NB6U5OTwitter: http://bit.ly/2DDeT83Instagram: http://bit.ly/2DEN7r3Discord: https://discord.gg/cB7ycdvThe Voice of Kurzgesagt: Steve Taylor: http://voice-pool.com/en/english/The music of the video here: Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/34L3USGBandcamp: https://bit.ly/38YgiC5Youtube: https://bit.ly/2CZ6PeNFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4 THANKS A LOT TO OUR LOVELY PATRONS FOR SUPPORTING US:Patrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, –ò–º—è—è –§–∞–º–∏–ª–∏—è—è, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, M√°t√© Szab√≥, Kasper Kylm√§l√§, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet"

But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. Oil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil - but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn‚Äôt do much about it.Unless‚Ä¶ we move our whole solar system out of the way.Support us on Patreon so we can make more videos (and get cool stuff in return): https://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt?ty=hSteady: https://steadyhq.com/de/kurzgesagtMerchandise:  https://shop.kurzgesagt.org Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/cRUQxzFacebook: http://bit.ly/1NB6U5OTwitter: http://bit.ly/2DDeT83Instagram: http://bit.ly/2DEN7r3Discord: https://discord.gg/cB7ycdvThe Voice of Kurzgesagt: Steve Taylor: http://voice-pool.com/en/english/The music of the video here: Soundcloud: https://bit.ly/34L3USGBandcamp: https://bit.ly/38YgiC5Youtube: https://bit.ly/2CZ6PeNFacebook: http://bit.ly/2qW6bY4 THANKS A LOT TO OUR LOVELY PATRONS FOR SUPPORTING US:Patrick Hall, Evan Wenden, riz, Nick Rose, Kevin, Patrick Huizinga, Mike Chang, Deddy Jobson, David Nir, Danny Mill, Kai Hebeler, Gabriel Averett, Pierre Xavier, Rohan Kapoor, Bray Demonbreun, Olivier L, Jared Capelle, Mike, Pierre Krenn, Kristofer Kirss, The Captain, –ò–º—è—è –§–∞–º–∏–ª–∏—è—è, Marie Samira, Hekmon, Dsurian, Martina, William Wold, Carston Cook, Daniel Bruce, Milan Juza, michal pol, Dmitry Sadakov, Brian Tieskoetter, kagami suigin, Rosamelia, Amir Johnson, Spencer Byars, Jarrod Parsons, Tayler Martin, bmwniquester, Saito Nakamura, Arnulf Kraan, Emilia Liu, Roosevelt Perry, Frank Blood, M√°t√© Szab√≥, Kasper Kylm√§l√§, Zach Riddle, Damian Campbell, XeleX55, Johann Pardanaud, Cemil Urganci, 3theNet"
